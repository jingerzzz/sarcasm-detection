734    That is why we believe so many heinous things about people like Sanders 
735    Your previous comment didn t seem to indicate you actually hold that belief 
736    it does very slightly resemble the flag of the British Union of Fascists
737    If that s the case   Heller  is also void and you cannot have guns for personal or home defense

788    Considering many people were killed trying to escape I think it was a case of self defense 
789    I m sure the schools and services in Newark and Baltimore have been doing much better under their Democratic mayor  town council  and state legislature by comparison  right 
790    Snowden also exposed state secrets to foreign powers through  presumably  gross negligence 
791    Here we go again  vote manipulation   
792    And you ignored the  signd by  error on the agreement sheet      UNINSTALLED AND LEFT A NEGATIVE REVIEW  
793    Have you tried eclipse

796    I mean  one of his biggest supporters  Rudy Ghoulliani is a transvestite so I m sure he will be great for the gays 
797    Even when it s a close call people pull the  hey dumbass  card but I can dig what you re plantin fren
798    but the government is doing it  so its not bad
799    It d shift from short periods of chaos to somewhat longer periods of unstable order and it d go on like that until people found a system that seemed to fit for the most part 
800    To see if someone s brain can survive just being in a vat of fluid  and be fooled into thinking it was normal and had a human body and experience everything through a computer simulation

818    This is why New Zealand exists we use to export most of our food to them i m sure they will want our old trade deals back once they leave the EU 
819    So demonized Yuto to fuck with Shun Kaito and his demonized original form to fuck with Ray 
820    You could probably visit where the old TCU campus was

842    Exercising 
843    It s the difference between chopping down the tree and drying out the soil

851    I dream of turboing an Iron Duke in a    Tempest 
852    Massive Faraday cage around the whole country 
853    It isn t even a decision  more than half of the time the dash flings cupid so far out of position that the steroid is not worth being sandwiched between the front line and the back line
854    He s not your buddy guy 
855    Black beast in this ho

868    I need some context here
869    people have opinions you commie loser
870    The Catholic Church is literally Sauron
871    I think somebody started a rumor that Trump bought Disney
872    Sure  if Comey  Putin and Assange will do the same 
873    Collard Greenes 
874    but that document was clearly doctored    regardless  a guy with a name like Barack Hussein Obama is clearly the antichrist incarnate 
875    Congratulations  you just made the man delete his account 
876    Thats just pubic hair
877    winkyface must be the new

880    Of course  the Russians made your dog poop where he shouldn t as well
881    Skip to Pearl Islands
882    Only in the hands of those who are really good at initiating  otherwise i think it could be a really bad laning choice and will almost always give up the early push in lane and will have no pressure etc   But if you have someone like Mata playing alistar  then yes its defo pick or ban

899    clear enough to speculate  vague enough to frustrate   GG Capcom indeed  
900    Yes  but Europe is definitely socialist  right 
901    Follow my wife Follow I Follow my wife and I Follow my wife and    ME   
902    I agree with you in the sense of two things  I need the return of ribbons
903    Very willing

927    This is by far the edgiest post I ve ever read       
928    I really need to start using
929    Duh  it s called Nauru 
930    Pyongyang Times has some good insights
931    I feel like since they accidentally had the lootboxes show up on the xbox store that it s going to be quite soon  possibly even today 
932    Wow  never heard anyone mention that before here 
933    Do I need this to run Skyrim Special Edition 
934    Yeah  after all they wouldn t default a meme subreddit 
935    If they fixed it they d lose Korea though 
936    Japanland 
937    Good  now we need another geographical profile of this unsub
938    And mobile cancer tablets 
939    It s no news that Russia ignores other countries  merits due to political attitude  the USA due to cultural attitude 
940    It was love at first gun point to the head 
941    Nearly  bars and the like wouldn t be able to sell it  but otherwise  that seems to be the case 
942    I figured they would be expensive but where does it say the actual price 
943    Aw  come on  CA is very big 
944    headshooting using strafing is a pretty good technique actually  in most peek fights you dont do that much aiming  you see where the head is posisioned and then you strafe  you have peek advantage  if you go vs a guy that has already set your head height and he starts straffing i believe he will likely kill you since you are trying to correct head height every time
945    Thank you all 
946    the technology just isnt there yet
947    There s no  i  in denial

959    How dare you insult the glorious color buff
960    Buy it before hand since its legal  leave it sealed so you can get thru security  get a locker or use a friend s to keep it in the venue 
961    Can t wait to fuck up my dick
962    I would also recommend the awper to retreat towards T spawn  because if CTs will decide to save in the middle of rotation  they will most likely stay closer to their own spawn 
963    much much better to let the jobs leave 
964    There s a boot every half hour for the rest of the game  though 
965    I don t think it s fair to use dozens of comments made by conspiracy theorists to suggest that conspiracy theorists might like Jews  everyone knows that the conspiracy movement is about the truth not anti semitism 
966    If that s the only reason you re glad  you really need to get your priorities in order 
967    Have you tried being attractive 
968    Yeah  I had to turn the channel and I mean they just slo mo ed that flashing light thinking that people don t have epilepsy or something  smh

981    Cmon guys there are literally crazy people on this sub but this ones an obvious
982    Oh you can t call this out now  anti semitism is illegal

1019    Watch it now on YouTube in handy   minute installments 
1020    My guess would be that they are still going to go with Blackburn  but since UTC s football coach took the Richmond job then UTC needs him to hire a coach there first 
1021    How have we already forgotten the broken AP kog before Riot nerfed it     
1022    I never thought of holding a gun to a girls head until after she married me 
1023    Well  I mean  we can t have the voters thinking he DOESN T hate black people  now can we

1026    bully seminar incoming

1060    Pedophilia in the highest circles of government is impossible and has never happened before

1079    Luffy who is not on admiral level yet is getting the upper hand on big moms executive   and Jack is sleeping with the fishes after clashing with admirals Marco on the other hand managed to kick an admiral who possesses the power of light accros marine fold   block akainus attack and take a direct hit from garps fist   borsalinos lasers and still get up like it s fucking nothing Jozu with his diamond fruit and haki is probably close to invincible and this is just a speculation but could probably win against both jack and cracker as they are using brute force and weapons in combat rather then elemental attacks We don t know how strong ace is because he got beat by blackbeard who is probably the main antagonist so he has plot armor   his devil fruit is one of the strongest in the series

1093    But insisting someone fix something without offering a solution is one of out greatest past times 
1094    They re following me to work from Richmond obviously
1095    No  you are an illegal 
1096    Because they re brown and the Satanic West loves to oppress brown people 
1097    Oh  only       sounds like a bargain 
1098    Yes  north of portage is frightening 
1099    No silly  it s  a joke  
1100    But   but they should be free and Apple should swallow the costs of R amp D and manufacturing because I am mad about the lack of headphone ports and they should only please me 
1101    Totally vindicated 
1102    I too saw the video 
1103    I ve read them both  it wasn t a serious suggestion  but he wrapped up Wheel of Time quite nicely when it was out of control 
1104    Good to see Sony throwing money at the important third party exclusives
1105    I wouldn t have guessed from your username
1106    The estimate is         so it s roughly in that range 
1107    I don t see how you could have been late  three seconds isn t a very large amount of time 
1108    Well there s like ten people there so I m sure one odd comment at book club fueled that search 
1109    You re racist only when you re white 
1110    That s what they call their dad
1111    lol ya let him just wake up at    and try out for a professional sport
1112    Those people with the Trump signs risking people attacking them and damaging their property have more courage than apple ditching the headphone jack
1113    can I wear my hawks jersey when we play a central team 
1114    And clearly  rude gestures by some sailors  and  spying on a country  are on the same level
1115    Ahh yes rust is well known for being realistic
1116    AZAMI BEST DARK UNIT 
1117    Obviously Target s fault for her hurting herself by picking up a needle in the parking lot left by a drug addict
1118    but   but    but    it s a Christian school  it cant  be   
1119    This is madness 
1120    Because throwing thousands of dollars at the game will make you better than someone who has spent    
1121    You sound butthurt
1122    There is a Toronto BLM  they mostly just disrupt traffic and the pride parade  doing real important work
1123    I believe the EE song  Archangel  on Origins had a similar lyric top this
1124    DLC   has been announced as a PS  exclusive Despite feelings about the ending  This kind of made my day    How is this a fun fact  Sh t   Yeah they really helped out Haiti  not disappointed  this was exactly what I expected to be  They dedicated two blocks to this travesty  interviews are supposed to be informative  we re supposed to walk away knowing something we didn t know before  This interview didn t do that and it wasn t funny one bit  Trevor asked Bills opinion on three pointless pre approved topics  all this appearance was for was to make uniformed viewers believe that the Clintons are good people  that s why Bill bragged about helping Africa  they aren t good people    If I have learned anything because you have a cold you will be dead by the end of the day or you are already dead and your body double is now posting for you  the reaction to humans of new york makes me think so  she has the respect of tons of women  and men  because we all share a common experience  i cried in the shower this morning bc i have a stuffy nose so she has least has my sympathy vote    Yet another reason I will never eat crab  chicken or tuna salad  ever  Great  Now I have this image of the doctor brushing her teeth with it    Please tell me what other requirements there are to your rubric so that I can go investigate and send you my research  I m talking at rallies here where he is on his own  obviously a staged speech at the convention will be very thought out    But that would be rape  tap on the shoulder would ve sufficed     The pokemon anime is still going  Unpopular opinon  I don t care what happens with the anime as long as the games are good  anyone else feel the same  Based on recent trailers  SUMO will probably be the best in the series  A complex plot very out of place for Pokemon and more akin to JRPGs  alchemy  etc etc  make me think this  The games look amazing    glad to have you here Don t worry in a few days you won t have to think back that far   Oh but but but that doesn t mean you re not an iPhone fanboy     s    HTC m  g  v   s  note     Because they are only the best and greatest websites  right  North Korea Accidentally Lets World Access Its Internet And It Only Has    Websites   I ll give you    m if you figure it out I think Woox had something to do with Litt s ban      Nice choice of font for the tutorial Taking the perfect photograph in GTA V  xpost r gaming    This is an early      DaimlerChrysler car so technically it can use the badge  I can t put my finger on it  but this Mercedes looks a little off    id  They re here    Beating up white people equals solving racism obviously  BLM agitators strip man naked  beat  kick and drag him through a Charlotte  SC parking garage    Sure   with such an important issue you would certanily expect them to respond immediately    What an amazing response time from their customer service    I have a    GB Samsung Evo SSD will make it faster btw   well yes but those are cheaty pow lifting good morning squats Ya  I get it after getting into heavy back squats again    powerlifters are just doing weightlifting assistance exercises anyway Squat is an assistance exercise for her anyway       M more to break even   SuicideSquad stays in Top   for  th straight wknd  Ties  Deadpool for longest streak for any comic book pic this yr        M dom cume   Gotta fill that gender wage gap somehow  She s building a tax base to fund the rest of her life after her looks drop off a cliff    Obviously that s what I meant  Clinton won t get your vote because the DNC filed a motion to dismiss with a standard legal argument    Liberate the Doggoteriat  A must read for every comrade pupper and doggo    She s just brainwashed by the patriarchy  Oh yes they can  He s sexist because reasons  They won t let a little fact like his hiring a woman for a key position defeat the narrative    yes because hillary is the beacon of truth  she never lies   At first glance  you d think Trump  This is because he has a much higher false truth ratio than Clinton  However  the large majority of Trump supporters are not swayed by any negative results of fact checking  They trust him to figure it out when he gets there  and like him for his unfiltered rhetoric    I bet all her mom friends love her  she must be such an nice person to be around  If you don t get fat  everyone will hate you    haha thats hilarious Check the username    Yeah  it s totally made up Lol the Chinese boogeyman hysteria again    But the janitor does a shitty job of cleaning so we just get rid of him and then everyone will clean up after THEMSELVES  You say that like monopolies don t form regularly in unregulated markets  and as if the behavior and abuses of said monopolies are not the reasons we enacted regulations in the first place    nobody cares I was in the video of r    not to brag  now to wait til someone says nobody cares   I didn t know Zekt had brothers  Doge Frontier   Even more when they re ahead at the end of the game    The game thread is gonna get crowded when Arkansas is ahead in the  nd or  rd quarter    He hires the best people Then it s a gross miscalculation because women are a way bigger voting bloc than Cubans or charity wonks    How much are you asking for the champs NMDs  I have some of the Champs exclusive NMDs in size     Also have some Chalk UBs in      just to let you know    Na yo those are caves where mohammed did sacred islamic traditions the jews have no rights to it cause they just showed up in the   th century Caves in Which Jewish Revolt Rebels Hid From Romans      Years Ago Found in Galilee   Ha ha you saying this like DE ever intended to do a proper rework for Saryn and not a kneejerk nerf    Saryn s Spores should interact with all forms of Toxin Damage  Playing a lot of Saryn I ve run into a sort of wall  My weapon choice is always shoe horned into using a Gas Toxic build  Normally that wouldn t be a problem  unless you run into high level Grineer  Now my weapon is borderline useless against high level Heavy Grineer units and I m stuck waiting for my DOTs to finish it off  I propose that  like Toxin Gas      of the weapons Corrosive Viral damage is spread as Toxin damage amongst Saryn s Spores  This way players have more of a choice of what Damage type to bring to battle when playing as Saryn    Uncomfortable with the direction  aka landslide victory for trump
1125    Yeah  Allen s lacerated kidney last season should have been a red flag
1126    Probaly a laggy killcam  hitreg and other issues dont exist

1138    Totally agree  I was explaining his options primarily for the purposes of showing him why it was unlikely 
1139    Because putting yourself at risk for STD by hopping on every other dick you see and lowering those risks greatly by saving sex for a committed relationship are totally both disgusting worthy behaviors

1259    Yes  but it has a higher interest rate

1281    You can t understand Uganda culture
1282    It s snowing like shit downtown  wonder how many people show up to the game 
1283    More often than not  you get someone with no clue on how to play rein on your team  like the guy wastes his shield just standing in the open taking shots  doesn t call when fire striking  etc
1284    Yeah  go play with any of his card and take a massive power swing and miss

2835     Special snowflake  basically means  cis heterosexual white abled neurotypical males are the Default Humans and deviating too much from that is ridiculous 
2836    Probably from the locker room 
2837    It has a supressor

2871    The tattoo segment with the girl getting a cover up job     Gosh  it must be so terrible as a white person to be judged for something you choose to cover part of yourself with 
2872    Because Hillary Clinton is a  woman  and being against Hillary Clinton means being against  women 
2873    Why is this documentary not in the public domain

2879    I m working     as a PhD student while taking classes  but the good thing is i have no intellectual involvement I m just told what to do  exactly what to do  over    hour work days   days a week and my sundays I need to makeup any hours I spent in class in the lab    
2880    Trickle down economics definitely works

3121    That actually would be one helluva pull  Ice Rager would be even better though    
3122    Tuna

3124    Seeing as the YPG only aligns with the US in a common fight against ISIL and  as time goes on  they ve been aligning increasingly closer towards Russia and the SAA  the whole  American Imperialist peon  thing makes very little sense 
3125    Tbh  casual  rest only  puff dittos can get pretty fun 
3126    Missing out on D Bry vs Brock at WM   is always going to be my biggest dissapointment

3142    Arstotzka is greatest nation  comrade 
3143    Granted  people are  but I always notice the ones who leave to be old conservative uncles who start night clubs or liquor businesses in Miami

3151    Meanwhile  at the Legion of Doom   
3152    He was hydrated and wearing dry socks 
3153    Because this one of the few posts that wasn t talking about the specs and he still brought it into the thread 
3154    This is a  very  good question 
3155    Because it was a competitive  match 
3156    But we need less regulation  right 
3157    Look for me on tomorrows flair betting thread  we can settle the beef once and for all

3167    Obama tortures daily by dropping bombs on children in the middle east  stop painting the picture that we don t do this already 
3168    To be fair  none of those kills happened specifically because of picking IQ 
3169    Under    is classed as a young driver so technically I am lol
3170    Well Obama was born in Kenya so that s no longer an issue these days

3191    Good lord let me guess you are a part of the everyone gets a trophy generation who needs safe spaces 
3192    Seeing how powerful memes can be  not to mention the memes with frogs and gorillas  I don t see why not 
3193    What am I missing that s so frustrating here

3212    Assuming it s a  being  capable of vocal language I agree 
3213    So as a follow up  do old people start to have less ADH  and that s why they get up to pee   times a night 
3214    Hey if you look at the last two games we played  it s ALMOST like we won one of them

3217    yeah we should just do what they re doing in the Philippines and let people extrajudicially kill each other if they suspect them of drug use
3218    On the bright side  at least it s no longer millennials fault for voting for Stein or Johnson

4571    Wait  I thought walking infantry into MG is how this game should be played 
4572    Didn t they both play basketball tho 
4573    Couldn t have waited for the Switch  huh 
4574    Yeah  instead of going to war  just undercut them in all their exports in the international market  give subsidies to local competing industries and work on the logistics infrastructure for those industries

4598    God  kids these days don t dab like we used to
4599    Yes Trumps driver is totally a mercenary
4600    Might as well get rid of speed limits on roads  because people are already speeding every day 
4601    Maybe not going to college is where I went wrong 
4602    Ur meant to buy the parts with plat or trade with people who have other syndicates

4624    Just ask Obama to turn it off 
4625    Why not use a controller 
4626    I thought Kirk s guitar had wah pedal pickups 
4627    and got booted     
4628    But that s gay and gross
4629    Without knowing anything or even reading the article  Im going to take the side of the police  because they are honest  just  and could never do wrong 
4630    Yep  and people didn t hate Obama because he s black either 
4631    Does journalism teach differences in two  too  and to

4640    If I were to guess  you probably didn t max out inserter capacity bonus  which is expensive and very late game  When blue inserters are at   magazines per rotation  they definitely are good enough to handle behemoths 
4641    Well  considering the amount of cocaine he does    It is not surprising at all 
4642    I bet Dana waited a couple hours between clips just to get a reaction about UFC not promoting Nunes etc

4644    I mean I d totally let some random person off Reddit into my house

4680    High resolution but it can only see in    fps
4681    Great idea  let s just throw away    months of development because people didn t want the armor sets the way they were presented 
4682    Of course it would  everyone wants    minute grind fests each game 
4683    I mean  he s literally bipolar

4687    Nah  he s going to pick up Boze and Silly 
4688    I think it s the other way around  cold sores are oral herpes 
4689    But there would be less room for salty crucible posts or people complaining about balances
4690    I mean obviously was
4691    Nah  not worth 
4692    Just like a true leader should 
4693    I understand his issue tho  having to actually look  or stop to make a right hand turn would grind the city to a halt 
4694    Also  drug runners and smugglers know about boats Yeah  build a wall  that ll stop  em  sure thing 
4695    Have the courage to not be able to add an SD card

4699    No one drives on coronation drive anymore  there s too much traffic
4700    No this is great news  now the market system will be forced to increase wages to teachers and everything will be great 
4701    You just don t get it  Man 
4702    With such consistency as Voltorb  Jynx  and Muk it s easy
4703    The lads gone mental
4704      and Mics

4713    Wow aren t you a cool bean
4714    Given Pakistan s track record  the onus should really be on them to disprove their involvement 
4715    I m pretty sure CBJ makes up more than    of the league

4722    All of Eastern Europe is Russia
4723    She can be inferior  I just won t respect her
4724    MTGO is not a good client by any means  magic is really expensive  but Magic is a really amazing game 
4725    Shit Lets nerf him again
4726    Yea  I would suspect our military and economic power around the globe to collapse the moment he takes office
4727    Yeah but they do it for themselves

4755    Underwhelming Fuck off Gladys Knight is the shit 
4756    Wow those are some classy people
4757    When backtracking means slowly drifting through a minute and a half of tunnels and such  then it warrants attention from the devs cos that s a pretty shitty state to have a basic mission in 
4758    It says so in the news so This Time It s DifferentTM
4759    lets get a youtube hero to block them for us

4771    The we ll discover that the exploding batteries were somehow related to the processor  don t ask me how  when Galaxy A   s start exploding

4791    How dare anyone be in support of the stadium 
4792    Is it possible for her to be in the shadow cabinet without either being an elected MP or a peer 
4793    I guess It s a feature then 
4794    But that s not his intention  so it s okay 
4795    Yes Son 
4796    i guess he wasn t extreme enough
4797    But the courts don t have any authority over them 
4798    just a frog 
4799    They don t let no mere fact get in their way of the  truth  
4800    I think it s bad form to criticize the umpires in New York for making such a tough call
4801    The Poll is Rigged 
4802    Thank you though

4814    I mean they only call him Remy several times in the movie and nobody ever calls him Ratatouille  easy mistake 
4815    It was just a little pinch on the booty nothing to throw a flag over
4816    I was told the same about downtown Boston and it actually seems like it may have gotten better recently    definitely a little peeved about band    performance being so horrible at first though  and still not great

4916    Amazing Playlist   Thank you 
4917    Only if you re from Russia 
4918    Structure battle that is not a keepstar against that kind of super fleet is basically feed and lose or blue ball and lose 
4919    It s President Elect Trump you smark
4920    dead mem
4921    Why did this remind me of Arby n  the Chief 
4922    Same boat  not my thing 
4923    Well  we have a new Guerrero family member  so it could happen 
4924    In that case I think we are over estimating the speed of the average modern human s speed  
4925    No his opinion is wrong 
4926    Thanks  man 
4927    Shovels  we have hands for a reason 
4928    So does this mean that we can start hating on Zeke for voluntarily donating to Salvation Army because they re homophobic 
4929    Indeed they do but I mostly mean the DBS aliens resemble Amanto 
4930    Dumbasses are their core demographic   
4931    Making Krassie AN gives us a better shot at getting out the puppy killer
4932    Which McGee do we get today
4933    Oops I think I replied to the wrong comment  I agree with your point 
4934    Isn t that the case for most of us in the Prairies 
4935    You don t need to get your ear drum ruptured to get Tinnitus  that s not how it works    
4936    It s for mobile users
4937    Savage
4938    Only when I also take a dump 
4939    The meta is always changing and yes  ground is more versatile but air will make a comeback  even if it s short lived  you want to be prepared for it 
4940    When it comes to what side of the road  I don t really see a difference at all tbh 
4941    Thats true but i was referring to playing with your kids instead of parking them in front of spongebob for   hours 
4942    There needs to be an off option 
4943    If you re not as into ballpoint pens you could always look at getting the Pentel energel bl     it s an all aluminum pen that takes Pentel energel refills and they are by far the smoothest gel refills available 
4944    Yup
4945    You re assuming people would only want the convention minifigures to complete a collection 
4946    Even if it makes you feel an uncontrolable desire to punch whatever whoever is playing it 
4947    because I fed mine don t know why T T
4948    It would be a really big callout to the market if they couldn t 
4949    What time does it start 
4950    Awesome  but why no Baez or Hammel 
4951    you really don t think that they re going to split the carries between the two 
4952    And I tryyyy Oh my  gosh  do I try 
4953    Well the   times thing is a stretch 
4954    Yet when adults do that  they re told they have an alcohol problem  
4955    With that logic  Tranzit is our favorite map 
4956    As a general rule of thumb  the more important the issue is to large numbers of working people  the less interesting it is to corporate media You don t say   
4957    Fuck all of the everything for doing etc 
4958    I think she got sick from having to be so close to the odious presence of Trump  I m really worried about the debates now

4960    Pm site
4961    RieserFS would like to have a word with you   
4962    When I was in high school we convinced my gym teacher that basketball had a four point line  anything past half court 
4963    No  for sure  but your response implied something very different 
4964    I m sure the Trump campaign will graciously appreciate the subtlety 
4965    KDE inherited the Microsoft mindset  always aim higher than what people are using  so people need buy new hardware and thus contribute to a thriving ecosystem where everybody is happy  except for the user  
4966    May your Goop never slow this speedwreck enough  clever dragon

4971    BE THERE OR BE A CIRCLE  WAIT
4972    What else 
4973    Lol no one reads the articles  no fake news is consumed 
4974    California is so expensive to live in  though 
4975      votes for the price of one 
4976    God is dead and we killed him
4977    I see you are from the Haidtian School of Esoteric Memetics 
4978    You forgot the
4979    Ori shows up with her ball MIA and she has a Shaco on her team so what else could possibly be going on besides them about to fuck you with no lube
4980    Fascism is real and Trump is the leader of fascist America 
4981    Name means Pseudo wood  meaning it s not wood
4982    That s racist 
4983    I will probably draft something  and come back to it in a few days to make sure that I have completely thought it through 
4984    And free will doesn t exist so might as well reprogram the meat robot and get him to do something useful instead of wasting all the resources that kept it alive for so long 
4985    Wasn t that ship sunk even earlier in one of the walkaround flashes were he straight up said the feelings were unrequited 
4986    Maybe he ll become a city landmark like Angelo
4987    Finnish here  normal for us too 
4988    Ya because Republicans worked together with Democrats for the past   years
4989    Lmfao shut the fuck up
4990    You must be aware that your brother is by no means an accurate representation of the average social conservative 
4991    Insecurities uh    find a way 
4992    In an election which Bernie surely would have won 
4993    If DMX had access to the internet when he was like     
4994    Do it if you think it s safe to do so   
4995    All the lefties that decided to move to Canada because Trump won are starting to make themselves felt over there 
4996    Corner Gas 
4997    I might be blind or just too tired but I don t see your point here 
4998    Yes  because girls moan and squeal full throttle when masturbating with family in the house 
4999    As a troll response  actually he didn t win 
5000    I hate that there are two UTs
5001    Never said it did  I was talking about the old man who started the whole situation
5002    Whoosh
5003    His album is hotter tho 
5004    I always wanted another recession 
5005    Sure bro  sounds like a great deal and because I know nothing about supreme I m gonna assume you aren t trying to rip me off 
5006    Ofcourse it s legal 
5007       million years later 
5008    Haven t gotten it yet
5009    The snek told him to get fucked
5010    not       
5011    I loved the series but they don t do TV series  Stranger Things was a one off because of it s    s films vibe 
5012    No  everything is all the same  and it s white people s fault regardless 
5013    You just can t accept N  Fredbear was a girl this whole time  can t you 
5014    Why do you say that 
5015    in a decent society  people like this are shunned instead of party nominees
5016    Oh god please no
5017    Just broke three personal records    Most hastily achieved erection   Most savagely dashed hope   Most hastily lost erection Thanks for that  OP

5021    What s this crosshair 
5022    The day we invaded Iraq 
5023    not that bad better than most of the shit they  make 
5024    This games physics suck
5025    So   THAT   was the first FNaF  teaser 
5026    Unfortunately not 
5027    Won t it be a problem that he was born in Kenya 
5028    Yeah  I have a Zdeno Chara stick that is     flex  a foot and a half longer than stock  and is probably     thicker than a normal stick 
5029    BC quora bana diya
5030    add me
5031    Obviously baby boomers have a long history of never rioting
5032    In your case  you could rub one out in that time period 
5033    Are you sure he s not related to   out of   of the beach boys after initially being related to   out of the first   
5034    A team like splyce should pick him up seems really good
5035    Very attractive
5036    Slather on a bit more patchouli and the bear will realize that you re a friend
5037    Not enough calories for American standard   
5038    Imagine what he could ve been if he had a work ethic like Ronaldo
5039    Yaaasssss Don Carlos 
5040    But my upvotes and tired jokes 
5041    Of the top of my head conservation orders on areas of habitat even if they fall on private land  with compensation of course and or a grant system to encourage farmers to voluntarily preserve and maintain land that would otherwise be left go to scrub 
5042    On the other hand Tychus is almost always available which is skyrocketing my MMR 
5043    Neither is the    k they could have made if they rebought at   and sold at      
5044    Any better than the Detroit Little Caesar s 
5045    Enjoy those tears because soon enough after Ryan and his ilk fuck up SS  Medicare and the ACA even more  liberals are going to be drinking in yours 
5046    Yeah  it just sounds like the free market meant these jobs were just less viable without the government intervening and forcing these jobs to remain when the market obviously deems them inefficient
5047    How does a baby know how to use reddit 
5048    But then they just tell me   Not today 
5049    You are less likely to get yourself killed if you stay at home reading books  so it makes sense 
5050    Just give him a chance 
5051    It s probably mostly corn fillers  so it s technically a vegetarian sandwich 
5052    Yeah  which is a load of steaming BS 
5053    Yeah  barely better than war golem
5054    Not sweaty enough
5055    Apparently and it is the worst thing ever 
5056        yup that totally happened
5057    Same

5059    Sorry  not deep enough  it isn t hitting the top of this massive pot 
5060    Just making America great again 
5061    Yeah  the guy who won the Clio Cup this year and only missed out on last year s title due to bad luck totally lacks the pace 
5062    Literally every single year Lundqvist plays bad at the start and then becomes a god

5068    It s not dead it s just not alive
5069    And the article yesterday revealed from which floor he jumped from 
5070    Don t forget that it s Obama who was really racially divisive
5071    He looked a little like plastic in the last few games but is on point this year
5072    They mention Arin off the cuff about his new animation project 
5073    Are those Model Ms 
5074    It s a good thing you posted it on Reddit

5077    Chaosh is a laddah
5078    Lol this is some of the most selfish shit I ve read in a while 
5079    Still waiting for that one guy to post how it s a repost 
5080    I refer you to my original post 
5081    No  but we re masters of passive aggressiveness and fellating customers 
5082    Didn t school teach you that having your appearance validated by a stranger is the best thing in the entire world 
5083    re re re reeeeepooooost

5090    Well Pence wasn t running for President 
5091    Considering the way that counterfeiters are handling Reserve List cards  almost all of them are scary good  but can t be sold as  real  to a person who has ever actually seen a card from the era   Im honestly surprised  Chinese printing  Duals and LEDs aren t more prevalent 
5092    Winnibg olimpyc gold is like winning XFL championship
5093    NBK was the best support in world when playing that role
5094    Man I love Rancid  and pretty much all of their albums 
5095    That smile though   
5096    He should use         because         has issues that mess with online gameplay over wifi 
5097    But only shillary has echo chambers
5098    How many more votes would PRESIDENT Trump have if they recounted crooked Dem states 
5099    But they have a mandate to do as they wish

5101    Scouting grounds looked like a really chill environment wish we could see more    
5102    Yeah but then the truck might get scratched  that s why we have the trailer 
5103    But dude  what if T D users aren t actually assholes  and their posts have just been edited to make them look like assholes 
5104    HIGH ENERGY
5105    We refer to ours as Rosie the robot 
5106    That would probably have been better for them  honestly

5112    I can t believe this  a    year old could see how crooked all of this is yet the left is going about their business as if it s all okay 
5113    Oh  so they like to get freaky eh 
5114    Conker s Bad Fur Day from N  
5115    But it s wrong to vilify an entire group of people because of the actions of a person or an extremist subgroup of them  except if they re muslim or mexican  then it s OK 
5116    Agreed  just pointing out that it is possible  and I imagine it will become more common as time goes on  so eventually it won t be an issue 
5117    NY Times asking the really hard questions 
5118    I hope there s a scene with Tony Stark and Stephen Strange where someone says something like  No shit  Sherlock  and they both look at each other or something 
5119    I too judge entire groups of people based on what   person says 
5120    I just wish I could manage to score ONCE so I could finish off that damn quest

5131    So what you re saying is PSU needs that quality loss this weekend to sneak up into the number   spot 
5132    Fuck  I bet you feel stupid
5133    I wasn t aware that our behavior set the mold for every other advanced civilization
5134    A man worries that a woman won t suck his dick  but turns out she sucked    dicks in a row

5136    Well with the new Ottoman events  government type  the updated missions  I would give them another try

5139    I knew my glass botle soda habit would pay off 
5140    Grow home would make a fantastic VR game 
5141    Nothing  because I wouldn t have to work 
5142    Glad to see my home town San Antonio reppin  on the front page   
5143    Yeah  I expect we ll improve pretty dramatically on last year with a new coach and a  fingers crossed  better injury list  but based on those statistics I can t realistically see any other club being shit enough to fall below us on the ladder 
5144    I m expecting the Russos making a surprise appearance and showing the first hour of Infinity War
5145    No don t you see the paint tray 
5146    Because you need GeForce experience to use an Nvidia card
5147    It s like Alex Jones and Huffington Post had a disgusting love child
5148    This is a sub of tolerance 
5149    That would work except that some phones get rid of unneeded bands and more likely than not you will get a carrier locked bootloader

5208    The Keyblade Graveyard looks weird in this picture 
5209    Women amirite 
5210    Well they can also instead replace it with a built exilus which wouldnt feel like bad for most people  or they could just put      more on each potatoes Anyway  all I want is that they at least remove this shit   reward   and add a token system 
5211    I have contacted them  hopefully they allow me to raise the fee but that will probably require me to wait a couple days for the transaction to be cancelled first sadly  or possibly they can do the double thing with a higher fee to overtake the first one 
5212    But I thought the CIA was our friend now
5213    Deet

5443    No like I am by no means a hardcore gamer but this dude is always trying to tell me how I m playing this game wrong so I am going to prove that I know what I m doing
5444    It was always in the game  just at an occurrence rate which made it statistically impossible to get in any reasonable time  it s completely untrue to say it s only just been hotfixed in when it was technically available all along 
5445    Except the prequels did not have an unproven director and they were a huge commercial success 
5446    FO Mahonys would probably be your best bet if you go this route

6864    I could argue  arresting  somebody hasn t been shown to have any positive effect either 
6865    Well all the other responses are pretty       but I would go with Hoyer

8326    Yeah man  trash talking your own team when they re people you don t know personally  through a medium that does not convey inflection and connotation is generally a great idea 
8327    I heard he s russian

8907    Do you have any picture examples so I get a feel for how provative you are talking 
8908    If it quacks like a duck

8947    But Chrome is such a RAM hog
8948    Yea  I wish Tanner Glass was in the line up to stop hits like this

8956    Yes but he pulled the  birther  issue on a non white president cause of the color of his skin so that makes him racist 
8957    Yeah and shotguns weren t OP aswell and we just should have forced defenders to long range fights across the whole map   why are people so stupid and never tell those things to Ubisoft before they do nerfs 
8958    I hate the be the person that bitches about not getting free shit  but i just don t like the whole thing of them saying all these people are getting free stuff in chat but then it seems the whole xbox community gets nothing

9018    How very fucking racist of you  
9019    Of course the Patriots cheat again   
9020    Humans do too Source  puke when I m stressed
9021    Sure  he needs to take ownership of being abused 
9022    And yet with absolutely zero evidence against hillary and the clinton foundation  it somehow  raises questions and cast shadows 
9023    Yeah  lynching is at an all time high 
9024    Sounds like somebody s palace chase got denied

10552    riot isn t going to ban him if he doesn t do anything that is banworthy 
10553    If only I could do that when someone somewhere in the internet disagree with me 
10554    He calls himself a  college grad  in the title 
10555    I m not surprised you re so fucking lazy you can t figure it out yourself 
10556    How do those people hide the crazy allowing them to go on a date 
10557    What if it was supposed to be LOL  
10558    We had them but I was to busy playing   square 
10559    If we can t come up with effective forms of activism other than appealing to the establishment in its own courtrooms  we re  really  in trouble 
10560    I think we might all be confused by what you re looking for    doesn t most any high school have a track

10582    Thanks for making me laugh today hahahahha
10583    They lose intensity of flavor over time  but it s not like drinking expired milk 
10584    It s not a sim 
10585    yet NMS lack content more than most Early access well known titles xD
10586    Yes  but  bootstraps  
10587    since they gave it no camo i am totally not excited about it also changing   tanks that are so different without giving a free crew reskill is cheap moneygrab of wargaming
10588    I liked it  was hoping for a sequel  but it s been a couple of years now  I m not getting my hopes up 
10589    According to eurostat  they had        applications in the first five months of

10593     The King in the North
10594    Omg u ruined my day    
10595    That s the first thing that popped up into my head when I saw that idea too  as much as I like variation in maps  I do still prefer to keep the core mechanics in place 
10596    cry me a river 
10597    And by that do you mean they exclusively kill Filipinos or what 
10598     just as planned   right 
10599    I just bought apple     per kg 
10600    Just drink beer instead 
10601    How long what kind 
10602    It sounds like you probably need to call a professional  or do a lot more research 
10603    BUT DIDN T YOU KNOW PROMOTING OUR OWN COUNTRY FIRST IS TOTALLY LIKE HITLER AND HATEFUL
10604    Weird  I thought we were living in      
10605    Except for dx   games    Where the     currently works better   
10606    There is an artery on the right side that would be compressed by the fetus if the woman were to lie on that side 
10607    What are the odds that we can use modding tools to disable all the stupid hero powers and just make the game into a better looking Quake   
10608    Just like how almost all of California s population is centered around two major cities 
10609    As my Western counter parts say whenever there s a white supremacist killing rampage    let s wait for some more information before we jump to any conclusions   He could still have a political motivation  in particular Muslim immigrants coming to europe  like idol  Breveik 
10610    Yea we just shouldn t even bother since it probably won t work 
10611    If the  Best and the Brightest  made it illegal  who are we to oppose them 
10612    Because all soldiers are baby eating rapists  obvs 
10613    This takes things too far I don t know if my heart can handle it
10614    It s simple  if you can t fix everything at once why try and fix anything at all
10615    cheers 
10616    So you are saying the rest of us aren t getting the whole experience
10617    This comment is anti Polish  anti Catholic and made by communists
10618    Lolololol alright
10619    Lol
10620    Yes now that would be entertainment 
10621    No  only republicans are sexist 
10622    It s just going to swing back 
10623    But we already have that here
10624    Horror is my favorite genre  but most horror movies are mediocre to bad 
10625    I like her just because I know shes going to be a great main villain now that she s free of all that family and sanity that was holding her back 
10626    Well yeah  she hasn t gotten to the small pa roads yet 
10627    what about the lifetime hit of the SSD from re scanning files multiple times mindlessly 
10628    back out of HUT and go back in that s what I had to do 
10629    It started when we were younger you were my    
10630    Packages and the dream Cocytus 
10631    Yeah  completely reasonable that simply because they re not into you  they must not be into any men at all 
10632    we could have bought the entire newcastle team  waste of money 
10633    What s skype 
10634    That s because their wives weakened their family value when they turned    
10635    Spinning flax
10636    So in the end  going GTK  saves a bit  not because of GTK   it is actually heavier on a pr program basis  but a whole lot of other things  including not having both GTK  and GTK  loaded for  reasons   
10637    Like    no  it s not a joke  but I appreciate your helpful  and very useful response 
10638    I had those  Max Memory  cards with a weird shape so these were never useful for me   
10639    Yes because the best posters are always massive spoilers   
10640    Lol go away 
10641    Probably not 
10642    Or maybe they were pig kin  you disgusting otherkin phobe 
10643    I figured  that s still terrible   days    hours extra no one wants to go through
10644    My legs tensed up
10645    I think I  triggered  the person you replied to   
10646    fuck
10647    There is no such thing as too much Rick and Morty 
10648    Oh well  guess I have to fire up Modern Warfare   again
10649    Get some     alcohol and clean that bitch    just cleaned mine and it looks feels like I just bought it 
10650    yeah he killed an innocent gorilla just to save some kid
10651    I think we will need a new time unit shorter than attosecond soon to measure the amount of time needed for German State to be called racist after they will reveal those IQ test results
10652    So what was it 
10653    Nah  we need a recast barely younger than Star Wars Harrison Ford movie 
10654    We lost another one  boys    could have added another   XX to the ranks if it weren t for that damned infantry getting in our way 
10655    it probably took them an hour to write that tweet
10656    Quick cash grab       LUL 
10657        a primary semi auto  a shotgun  a sniper  a revolver  and sometimes a heavy weapon automatic gun
10658    The truth is so offensive 
10659    Rifts  
10660    I remember reading an article where someone from the Trump campaign essentially said that their goal is to keep Sanders supporters angry so they re less likely to vote for Clinton  since they know that very few will actually end up voting for Trump anyways 
10661    Still no problems on N 
10662    I sat through the whole two hour red nose special just to see the TWD cast last night 
10663    People shouldn t anoint him as the future  but there are a lot of reasonable people who feel he is at least a serviceable backup that won t kill the season like the guys last year 
10664    I have some snaps too  they look great but for people with normal to large heads they fit like shit  so shallow 
10665    No you see women are victims too in that situation because that s a result of society viewing women as weaker than men 
10666    Damn 
10667    As opposed to  uncovered Muslim girls who deserved it 
10668    Double majored in intemperative dance and liberal arts  am voting for Hillairy 
10669    don t play DR  or you ll wanna kill yourself all over again

10674    Yeah  I drank the koolaid for awhile   max level  the hard heroic raids  shunned any naysayers  then one day I woke up and realized God this game sucks 
10675    If firing through a closed door can be allowed to be called  self defense   why bother having a definition for murder at all 
10676    Something something sexuality spectrum more than two not binary blablabla nonsense
10677    Well  with this new bill  isn t it that as soon as a new substance hits the market  it  instantly  becomes schedule I

10716    In a game where they were expecting massive multiplayer space battles when that wasn t mentioned once and a game where exploration is the point less than an hour is no way you re actually going to start exploring properly 
10717    FWIW I had the same impression of the article 
10718    And simulor 
10719    BAH GAHD HE HAD A FAMILY
10720    Yes  being able to jump after a wallclimb was what was giving the top    of players a hard time against genji 
10721    Oh great  now we re REALLY gonna suck

10723    That seems like the rational response of an emotionally healthy adult 
10724    Op  get your money back It looks nothing like you And btw   if Sir Anthony Hopkins paints a picture of you  it s not a self portrait

10752    Why not Zeratu second skill instead 
10753    but but TI is the only dota event ever and its the only reason dota player out earn LoP
10754    This is why more people should watch NASCAR 
10755    Seems legit 
10756    It s Mexicans that are taking over the country 
10757    i hear SF has been looking for some OF depth

10761    GGG should listen to more people like you who don t play the game 
10762    Username checks out 
10763    Not sure they understand that states aren t winner take all
10764    Kewl    it s like the  Bull Pit  at Chuck E Cheese 
10765    Degenerate  weak  self hating liberals with no self identity beyond their shared hatred of all things normal

10778    fuk da polise
10779        Amen Break 
10780    He ll trade all the black guys he needs to to get him
10781     silently judges you while condescendingly posting about it 
10782    No   the vitamin D in the sunlight prevents DXM from properly metabolizing
10783    He s not really impaired if he s capable of capturing a raccoon 
10784    just retract them on final
10785    TIL  this is all Obama s fault and W was the best president ever 
10786    They must really hate ofw money 
10787    totally  games should only be decided by what cards are in your hand when the game starts  not what the cards do when they hit the board 
10788    Yeah because extra rooms and objects have absolutely no impact on the performance of the game whatsoever 
10789    but we need fewer regulations for our businesses and job creators
10790    Bone sharks and shockers seem to be affected as well
10791    Um Mitch you already promised your vote to Kelsey since she was a third wheel to get to the end   
10792    Laser pointer dot on the ceiling and human barking dubbed over is my guess

10794    Fallout  
10795    Something something Bush did     
10796    Backs statement up with absolutely zero data  how compelling

10802    Explain that this was inevitable 
10803    Are you sure it is the same        driver that he is using 
10804    I think you might have missed a few angles 
10805    More like   I ve spent whole day thinking on how to get that sweet ass karma on reddit  
10806    But drunks are just full of the Blood of Christ 
10807    Naw its gonna be the dinosaur plane just you wait and see
10808    That means it never happened  right

10814    yes a command economy dictatorship sounds good
10815    Looks like an old Gwinn Arms Bushmaster 
10816    Cultural freedom  we gotta respect their cultural right to raise terrorists 
10817    Is it because of the bathroom gender thing 
10818    This might be Danica s chance
10819    Oh  like that went so well the last time fire rained down on Tokyo

11163    Eh nothing a little duct tape can t fix
11164    It was also gilded 
11165    Yeah I can t imagine how this will immediately be massively abused 
11166    The LDP might retain their NSW seat  unfortunately  because they re ahead of the Libs in the NSW Senate ballot 
11167    Ryan Kent     y o u   winger 
11168    I don t care for the points either just thought it was funny if it was you 
11169    I think that this may genuinely be my favorite post on this sub to date
11170    Right  because ICE certainly never fucks up and deports a brown person just because they weren t carrying   different kinds of papers that day 
11171    I just might be crying harder    For my wallet of course
11172    this is a new and well thought out post
11173       but that s not important right now 
11174    Yup over      laps easy to get ahead in a high school type race where competition could be wide spread for such a long event 
11175    And I said I was theoretically studying physics  and boom they hired me 
11176    CERTIFIED DANK
11177    STAND BEHIND REINHARDT 
11178    OH GODDAMNIT 
11179         not racist enough
11180    So obviously if you do pull one from the tins you ll make your money back
11181    NAVI will not play 
11182    I don t even think I d watch football if not for fireman Ed or the barrel guy in the stands
11183    I ve had   copies of that damn Sigma thinking i d save a few bucks  But the auto focus on those lenes is horrible 
11184    r    fanart
11185    Shit     I could be comparing     years ago to now
11186    nah  i like having a very loose definition of pop music
11187    I m sorry   
11188    Well  if he had been around for the Eli trade  Manning s career would ve resembled Ryan Leaf s lol

11190    You can redirect the dragons if you ultimate as genji at the same time and slice them
11191    sicc grind  pupper
11192    no homo makes it fine
11193    In my opinion this is essentially directly supporting terrorism 
11194    They can barely keep electricity on in their country  let alone in the middle of the ocean 
11195    adderall
11196    But Trump isn t a fascist 
11197    It s just like multiplying negative numbers bro Melania is like the plagiarism Robin Hood  stealing from those who have stolen and giving it back to the people
11198    I think you mean from the left 
11199    To be fair  Jesus said the exact same thing 
11200    Until they re in the Finals  when KD disappears again
11201    It s those damn Amish again 
11202    So he is actually changing his tune about the EU to fight the even more extreme right from stealing his voter base    
11203    If by  the other Berserk figma s  you mean the rest of the god hand that appear on one of the pictures from the link you posted  unfortunately  I don t think they re out yet  just trying to save you some time  P
11204    How will you handle the server load from the traffic 
11205    Yeah  because players that will want to gamble will gamble anywhere they want 
11206    The Catholic Church shares it however 
11207    I love it when fledgling feminists feel that they re educated enough in the subject of their choosing  and decide to come forth to spread the gospel of Feminism and Racism caused only by white males  and no other people are at fault    Because anybody who isn t a white male is systematically marginalized and oppressed by the evil patriarchy that gives white men special powers and rights freedoms to commit whatever actions they want without consequences  because they re white men that are members of the patriarchy and force themselves upon every minority  person of color  LGBTQIALMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ member  and the rest of the special snowflake squad that I fail to name due to sheer laziness  and lack of motivation to do it 
11208    I caught one but the CP was nothing to shout about
11209    I laughed 
11210    He just wants to show off his expensive knife
11211    Well they need milk for a year before they switch to peanut butter and kool aid so there re not developing anymore then
11212    Your post has a grammar error  so not only can i not understand you at all  i also suspect you re inbred 
11213    Especially when his uncle is blood related and his aunt not   
11214    At least they aren t ruining Game of Thrones anymore  that d be ten times as horrible 
11215    And here I though I was perfectly OK and didn t have to wory about rushing things
11216    Yessss  going to be there this weekend 
11217    None of them were marked classified  so there was nothing illegal or unethical 
11218    Still sore about this years Stanley Cup 
11219    What about June 
11220    It s a big deal that it happened   it just wasn t fireworks to watch 
11221     Please  make a post about it  there s a chance some future fence sitter will see it and just maybe tick it off their list of reasons to have kids 
11222    I m so glad that what amounted to a temper tantrum in the brogressive movement because their feelings were hurt was not able to stop a female political leader 
11223    But then if you play what your team wants  who will cover  th attack hanzo 
11224    You disgust me
11225    Just stood there and broke his own neck i heard   
11226    So  you mean similarly to all the black people letting it all out when Obama was voted into office after      years of oppression 
11227    He didn t defraud people  only darkies
11228    Not really  poor wifi connection does
11229    That s why I ask my bagger to leave out   zucchini  they re basically the same thing 
11230    Hence why Americans are world famous to be the smartest people ever  impressing all other nations with their vast knowledge of geography and History for instance 
11231    Hey black hues matter 
11232    a good journalist covers all options 
11233    That s right people  if you don t believe Hillary murdered multiple people you re just a CTR shill 
11234    Extra emphasis on complete
11235    Seriously  some of the most loathable characters in this series are portrayed by the most talented actors actresses 
11236    You re so savage 
11237    But you are though 
11238    Is that a   gallon tank 
11239    He says  posting to Reddit 
11240    Lol ya  I m guessing based on the boots he is wearing that he isn t very high up and was able to walk there  but I hope he has atleast one other cam 
11241    I feel stupid but am I missing a reference here 
11242    I m mostly convinced this is fake based on how long the long the lightning lasts for it being such a quickly played time lapse 
11243    That guy should not have dogs
11244    Use Google
11245    man I hope CTR pays you enough for this
11246    you re annoying and ignorant
11247    B there or b square
11248    He doesn t even know what magazine it s from 
11249    Well  for the backend one can use anything  probably Rails or Django to stay  dynamic    I ll show myself out   
11250    Clearly  who would muddy that up with allegations that he s going to be given an acting gig 
11251    Because  even though Mark has clearly said not to do it a thousand times  they re still attempting to use WD   as a lubricant 
11252    the only thing not constrained by the blocksize limit is the size of greg maxwell and adam back egos  
11253    Well  this definitely was a solid alternative post to make
11254    First amendment motherfucker

11264    i m sorry but this must be one of the dumbest things i ve heard
11265    Woah  I didn t know Jack Black was one of the lost boys 
11266    The place that had ice cream
11267    How original 
11268    Large scale racism only exists when it s institutionalized
11269    I thought he was the next legend 
11270    it is impressive how fast he can dig with such small hands 
11271    This is why y all getting curved
11272    Oh he won t but you gotta believe him cuz he said he was masters 
11273    Assuming none of them dope already  and only the rest of world dopes those unethical heathens  
11274    When I unsubbed 
11275    Seems a bit harsh to call our entire military dumb   
11276    I thought heat rises
11277    And your inaccurate  uneducated and off the wall replies with no validated opinion are 
11278    Great idea 
11279    Because Thorin totally doesn t have an anti TSM bias 
11280    For a new player that must be a cake walk 
11281    Because the state government of TN is an independent woman that don t need no national tax to support her
11282    Every time 
11283    No one in my Facebook feed agrees with you so you re wrong 
11284    Np I like to see happy people

11286    He has got a lot of potential 
11287    What console  P
11288    A  Computing Teacher  should know that that s an example of recursion  not an infinite loop 
11289    Obama apparently  spends all his time hatching and executing evil plans that thwart the plans of true  patriotic Americans 
11290    Alliance favoritism as always  blizz 
11291    Looks like you forgot your
11292    I m shocked that a gym of all places would try to exploit it s patrons 
11293    Well color me surprised 
11294    Look at all the energy and excitement in the crowd 
11295    There have been rumors of that forever sadly   
11296    Damn I am angry now

11314    but you lifted    p   y  P
11315    Different countries  different politics  different funding models  different cultures  different tourism infrastructure  etc 
11316    should of just bought them from GE
11317    Still salty from the penalty Benteke won last season 
11318    Sounds like a really useful and respectful way to spend your time 
11319    So people can get exactly a pound obviously 
11320    Yeah but it sends a strong message for homeless people to top up their myki 
11321    nono  they are fans of nice walls  not ice walls 
11322    What s he whining about  I thought we had a Kenyan muslim as our president 
11323    Future Sight mechanics are said to not count as returning mechanics  so    maybe contraptions have a chance 
11324    Not sure what you re talking about  Eclise inarguably has the best pose in the game
11325    Is this lube 
11326    Trust me I know that feeling 
11327    I think option B fits in more accurately with the lore 
11328    We all know  Tom  was an experiment by Feige to create a real life Peter Parker
11329    Yup he had great timing as well 
11330    I ve heard of using a crab boiler for it  it s just a tripod single propane burner for using at the beach 
11331    yes  because the station platform is where I need wifi and not on the train itself while riding 
11332    Yes it is 
11333    That s not how the internet works grandpa 
11334    Maybe if they keep pretending there aren t any women in Gamergate  they ll magically disappear

11336    Oh man  I hope Trump gets the nomination so that BOTH candidates in the general election are planned parenthood supporters

11497    Hey now   
11498    I personally didn t like Wiig in the reboot  more so I thought her character didn t really have a point 
11499    Sky High
11500    Hearing about it everywhere  and bored with my usual forum 
11501    You gotta have   copies of that bad boy  in case one breaks from playing it so much 
11502    You re biased and deluded 
11503    No  he thinks you are an idiot because you are acting dumb 
11504    Nice 
11505    probably  but we should not ignore the words of the people who have already resigned due to this 
11506    timers and masterballs are individually more broken than gust gtfo

11517    This makes my head  hurt

11520    If we get enough muppets in one building we can start our own show 
11521    Just started reading Rothfuss and he s very good and I can t imagine anyone who loves Sanderson not loving the Kingkiller Chronicles

11523       who was it 
11524    Is that a reference to something or did you just come up with that 
11525    Generally I think it s because of girls getting a lot more matches than guys  this probably doesn t apply to this girl however 
11526    Death of a parent at s young age 
11527    Yes please 
11528    The Garber special 
11529    I don t think we re in any position to know the answers
11530    You forgot the Book of Mormon with the Bible 
11531    I m also guessing you don t wear a smock and get looked down on by the customers as  the help   but your point is well made 
11532    Yes it was
11533    Shit talk him all you want  but he had a better career sv  with the Leafs than Reimer  who people seem to think is a lot better because of a couple months last season

11553    yeah  but generally  they were either being yelled at or being lynched   
11554    My point wasn t whether he was right or wrong  but that he seems to have an axe to grind with Paradox and looks pretty friendly with the CEO of a competing studio 
11555    You mean a modified blue thunder bomb  Maggle 
11556    Gratz you will now be level      
11557    He needs to drop after June  th or he tarnishes his legacy 
11558    The amount of time and money spent to get any good return is diminishing compared to the    minutes I can spend grinding 
11559    you really need the
11560    because you need some sort of centralized state IMO in the transitional period  as a MLM  I believe the solution to corrupt bourgeoisie elements revisionists infiltrating the state is cultural revolution

11632    The fact that AMD was able to significantly increase performance in such a short amount of time only make it seem more likely that Nvidia messed with the code of the game to give terrible benchmarks for launch day

11634    You act as if you don t have RPDR on constanty in the background

11672     wow they are all anorexic 
11673    And the refs
11674    He was still unconscious at the time  and if the  ER keeps that vision from him it s easy for Bran to assume he simply fell 
11675    Haha yea bro forreal I ve just recently started getting into the sneaker game because I do have a job and stuff but still when your about to go spend it and you think about it like dam these shoes are worth like   long hard   hour shifts are they really that worth it  talk my self out of it nah I ll just save the money

11679    The people at the very  very bottom own most of the debt

11689    Is no one going to address the blatant cultural appropriation going on here 
11690    OP hasn t even given his opinion on it  but when you hate a product to the point of mental illness  reality tends to warp around you

11777    No its not representative of many demographics but it is representative of some which would suggest that it has damaged her reputation with at least the demographics and considering wider data isn t yet available it is reasonable to hypothesize that the damage is wider spread than the demographics reddit serves

11850    Out of all the comments I ve seen on reddit  this is the one that pierces my unfeeling exterior  and causes me to consider that the little people might actually qualify as human  too  
11851    Micheal Phelps dives 
11852    Think you forgot this

11877      OnlyInMontreal   apparently
11878    I think this is the first post I saw about this 
11879    Bravo certainly wasn t considered world class when they bought him 
11880    This is the plotline to Memento isn t it

11892    is that the guy Kanye West made famous 
11893    It s ok  all the other eu migrants will have left as well  so the nhs won t need so many staff

11901    shut up ur racist
11902    Because this is a hentai made into a game 
11903    That s because Trump is literally the spawn of Satan and Hillary is Christ reborn

11910    and still  they would find a way to remove mechanics from it 
11911    What would he know about bad movies 
11912    Probably an xbox
11913    Was that last one an eel 
11914    Thorry Gergich
11915    The morality of the     s also included overt racism  does he want to bring that back too 
11916    But the Commie s  created  a famine in Ukraine  they are so much worse 
11917    Joey Bosa is clearly going to be a bust because the internet scouts said he can only play in a     and the Chargers run a         of the time and talent is only as good as the scheme they are in period

12278    Yes  sovereign governments often impose arbitrary  well  not really  they re based on the votebanks  tarrifs and regulations 
12279    And a car to the foot for good measure 
12280    It s the only good version 
12281    Your title is incredibly misleading compared to what OP actually wrote 
12282    Yes  because when guys talk about the difficulties of being men  we don t even think about how we make up     of workplace fatalities  or     of suicides  or die sooner on average  we only think about how it hurts to get flicked in the balls 
12283    Did Team America do good at the box office 
12284    it only means other providers are overcharging
12285    Looks like I m getting her a boyfriend who s spontaneous and adventurous

12301    Oct     Halloween  and Dec     New Years Eve  are pretty memorable dates  though
12302    Forcing certain people to choose between their religion and education sounds like a great idea
12303    When two main parties pick the only realistic candidates for public office and don t consider themselves public organizations  that s not really democracy  or even a republic to be honest 
12304    It would require Trump to replace high ranking officers of the military with his loyal puppets  and then assuming that they will all fall in line with Trump s demented idea to start a nuclear war 
12305    Yeah cuz Elige and Stewie have proven to be international superstars

12347          nice digs but the lighting made finding a vein harder than expected 
12348    Or better  take a shot and THEN do    push ups 
12349    Last I heard The Matrix was highly inspired by Equilibrium  hence the same clothing style and similar focus in firearm martial arts 
12350    If they insured every package themselves they d just pass those costs on to the customers 
12351    Yes  because their jihadis so far have all been faithful mosque goers
12352    Someone called for my assistance 
12353    Yes  because people who pay streaming services want to go to torrents and steal from artists 
12354    Nah  even when the defense as a whole is a sieve  people will scapegoat Monroe

12386    While that s certainly an option for most  I have a rare meme allergy that precludes me from ingesting large amounts of dankness

12461    Plastics fans

12506    Yeah those lazy modders    first they spent their free time on creating awesome mods and then share them with other players for free  but they are too lazy to upload it to Steam  how dare they

12508    Every raiders fan looks like it is though   
12509    The    M is the current generation of mobile GPUs and I assume the i  will be on of the latest as well

12512    I think this is hinting that he has a track with him and is going to play it tomorrow  or he s tributing the set to Gucci
12513    Hmmm I wonder who Mr Oz is
12514    HOBOMAN   THE HOMELESS HERO PORTLAND DESERVES

12521    deutsche haben doch alle an
12522    because it is totally disgusting that neo nazis and other hate groups can t legally perform nazi salutes at concentration camps
12523    The Holocaust

12526    I liked the dev idea of scientists roaming the island armed  slaying anyone they come into contact with

12536    Summon three     Treants that have    attack the turn they can t attack 
12537    I sure hope it expands upon the Thomas  amp  Martha Wayne murders 
12538    I think the comment is asking where he s from originally  cos I don t think many people from Europe would feel worried intimidated when walking by a group of policemen 
12539    because rito isnt a player focused company and are ded set on screwin us with DQ
12540    This is extremely accurate  and anyone that says otherwise is wrong

12563    Right because everyone should all think alike and believe the same things you do 
12564    NBA s only doing it so when the Warriors get robbed  it ll be without reproach

13536    Yeah it was really frustrating    First we went with the main event  then when that failed by less than     they restarted it via a guild  that run got even more swamped with trolls  and we failed hard    All in all an hour of concerted effort wasted

14882    Yeah getting a  th round pick for a cb who hasn t played since was very dumb
14883    Would happily but it from you  but I know I can t afford it 
14884    the irony is you have to use you capped broadband to complain
14885    I ended up looking at my build sheet just to check
14886    Perhaps form    people to fight the    man roaming gang 
14887    The answer to that first question is suck on them 
14888    I don t know we have discussed him and the other victim here on reddit MANY times and it has been in every paper over the last   months several times 
14889    And the cows will not eat feed covered in pigeon poo 
14890    She obviously did something that made him do it 
14891    Well  I mean we re all on gear so we don t have much down there
14892    better than what i could do 
14893    fearmongering

14897    what s an even bigger pet peeve of mine is that so many people here act like JK  does  know  and create elaborate theories and then subsequently proclaim JK a genius JK might be a great writer  but please   please  don t delude yourself into thinking her works can hold up to even a basic mathematical analysis
14898    Anytime not in the winter and Milwaukee is still better
14899    I imagine feral rage is in there to help control the board prior to patrons 
14900     and
14901    We
14902    iirc Dameshek is a Steelers fan
14903    Aka the guy who made Marcelo Huertas a legend

14907    I think the game really pulled off what Dead Island wanted to be
14908    Eh then what is the problem     
14909    The old spice blocked water  just like how it blocks bidy odor  from entering the gpu so it s fine 
14910    Because most people don t like talking with randoms  and if they do  they don t want to get into salty arguments 
14911    What  D
14912    That could either be good or bad if Frank was involved in this tho   It could be good because it means we re getting an album soon or it could be bad because we re not getting an album soon because of all the drama

14950    No  you didn t use the loophole     you re doing it wrong 
14951    I think you re vastly underestimating how much of a pain in the ass adding a bunch of examine details is and it really adds pretty much nothing for the  vast  majority of players 
14952    its true my friend our tl wasnt retarded  sls all listened and called artillery where most effective with tls help  tanker was great  everyone was smoking the meatgrinder off in fact most of the people i saw were honor    or higher

15504    I can t stand when people talk about games that  won t work  in vr  look at Eagle flight or WWToons  you d be hard pressed to find a game that s more fast paced than ether of those  and I m sure those will make people sick  but a lot of people won t get sick and get to have a lot of fun playing them  what they need to do is offer small free digital download demos of any  dangerous  vr games so people can play them for a few minutes and know going in if they ll get sick and make an educated decision on whether or not to buy it

16110    There are only ever CTR shills or Trump shills 
16111    Yea but when they release two movies with the same plot every year for the last decade  it gets a little repetitive 
16112    That s one industry in Ukraine that seems to be growing well 
16113    We point at her and whisper 
16114    Oh yeah the    second trip to get a hydra buzzard really equates to the hours a CEO spent
16115    I think looking at fan support of the         Thunder  probably the only objectively bad season the team has had in the city  which the       record corroborates  may provide some sort of precedent  although the fact that it was the  inaugural  season may skew numbers a bit 
16116    Criminalizing a line of thought is a great idea 
16117    I saw a car on I  the other day that had  Dicks out for Harambe  written on the back window 
16118    The company I work for has sent me a friend request on Facebook

16134    I ve seen one at the downtown Fire Department  but it s only been one occurrence 
16135    It s not the trucks we should be banning  it s the engine components that made it possible for the truck to go faster speeds 
16136    Fuck off 
16137    Reckful with the current drama had like   k
16138    I think it s more about not wanting anybody else to have it than about specifically wanting Victor to have it

16153    I m sure a lot of players would happily sacrifice a lot of trophies to get their hands on the World Cup scoring in every game bar one on the way as well
16154    That HS number is nice 
16155    I don t think they are  but it s hard to really focus on both at the same time 
16156    Well  I understand English  and my point that the wording is ambiguous and allows for the infringement of that right stands  regardless of your patronizing tone 
16157    Hmm after reading that I don t think I ll ever correct anyone on the internet again   I m not smart enough to do it without it blowing up in my face like that 
16158    Why are they decked out in swat gear 
16159    Maybe there is more to it  but I m fairly sure saliva is the primary factor here 
16160    What GPU are you waiting for 
16161    Trump is friendly with Putin  so it s ok

16175    Yeah  we re all pros here after all including people just now starting the game  nobody here can learn anything else new from PoGO or try to share knowledge  p
16176    Guess I should have added the
16177    Funny thing is when the Conservatives in Canada tried ads attacking character they got laughed at by most people
16178    Nah they just leech off the NHS mate

16180    Is ticket to ride a european board game 
16181    Op this is super generous thanks  I would love rust to play with my friends  thank you so much
16182    Honestly you d get a more genuine experience outside of tourist season    Depends where you plans on going though
16183    But I thought everyone on Reddit knew this game was going to be the biggest game ever and niantic was stupid for not allocating enough servers 
16184    I would probably scream in pure joy and have muscle spasms that cause me to throw my controllers at the wall if I met him in Rec Room 
16185    But how is Russell ever gonna see over those big tall linemen 
16186    you re both wrong  organ guns would be better
16187    That attitude only encourages us 
16188    I m talking about the NCR clashing with the east coast BOS not the west Coast ones

16190    time for more bans   
16191    No sos feliz
16192    LOL
16193    So is the unbelievable part that there is one  or that there hasn t been one before this 
16194    Oh yeah of course it is boring to watch that s why this new game already has multiple tournaments being run  with decent sized prize pools
16195    for one game that is
16196    If Trout s in CF  Conforto will be in LF for the Angels 
16197    He probably couldn t leave that out if he wanted to get a speaking slot at the DNC 
16198    I read it  and it just sounds like lot of hassle 
16199    But do you have your share of  tactical  Turtlenecks 
16200    Sigh    I guess it s time to upgrade my GPU 
16201    It is pretty much the same in any rural part of NV 
16202    To the front page 
16203    It s probably because Jews run the media and they don t like the Aryan look 
16204    Because   hours is just way to far to drive to drive to get your child some help
16205    Insuboordinate     and churlish 
16206    Don t be silly  the whale is obviously the hand of  possibly the Calvinist  God  and you are hunting the whale to establish your right to self determinism 
16207    consoles
16208    Foxy is girl confirmed

16212    I know a huge amount of people with dual citizenship and you can get passports from both if you want 
16213    ALL ITALIA OVVIAMENTE 
16214    That problem would be solved if younger people voted 
16215    Yeah  because Trump s Muslim ban will solve the problem 
16216    This is a trap 
16217    How 
16218    Started off a hit in Norway and faded as the season went on    Meant to be renewed but nothing confirmed based on final viewing numbers
16219    They are bourgeois degenerates 
16220    fuckin commies
16221    I did NOT  expect a TALKING SKATEBOARD 
16222    Maybe  but he still uses petroleum products and drives a car that runs on gasoline  just like you 
16223    Not with all the Clipper fans
16224    No  all of the left facing and right facing sprites are the same just flipped in software 
16225    Well then this bitch is cherry picking like a fucking farmer 
16226    I wouldn t care for rep if I am rich honestly
16227    Harambe
16228    This doesn t confirm anything      The jersey probably says    for      or it could be Burmi      Dano       Lipon     
16229    Gitgudscrubn  bnodank    mLgpr kwiksc p sfrumu
16230    I have Bashii  E  Rift  Brass Knuckles  Fury Song  and Enforcer
16231    An arduino or rasppi could function as the controller for a fraction of the cost in exchange for coding ability our taking the time to learn those platforms 
16232    Yes  you can even combo it with  The light shall burn you  emote 
16233    I don t know if I could  but I think this will be a last resort move for me 
16234    Yeah  life was really shitty before the     s  right 
16235    Yes  because all CoC builds require Voll s  amirite 
16236    You sound like a real catch
16237    It s all about the FOUNDATION guise geez 
16238    Not what I meant   
16239    Nice bait
16240    They dress like that to make themselves feel sexy  not so you do 
16241    Neither was the girl before the photoshop
16242    What sucks is the      photo limit   
16243    It s gotta be a metric thing  because if you look at some of the salaries below that they have much higher upper limits 
16244    Jesus Christ  what have we done  better pretend PvH never happened and nerf everything related to the Pyro real quick 
16245    Must be a leftover from  th gen
16246    this is like something i do in the beginning of a fifa manager career season  put in the all the big clubs over the smaller ones just for more fun   cause you know for the non generic computer generated player faces
16247    And  you know  it s pretty much a single player game 
16248    I determined we do not share an ideal 
16249    I m sure Osborne would supply you with acid 
16250    In the officers defense  they don t do much firearms training 
16251    Same thing happens with certain provinces in Britain  such as Leicester 
16252    You forgot this

16276    PureSpam or Ian
16277    Doesn t matter had sex
16278    Yeah it s also definitely not because some of us also believe that not every decision should be a business decision
16279    Then why is there still snow sometimes 
16280    But retribution feels so much better than actually improving a community  right 
16281    Because if there is one thing you should trust from the Patriots  it s injury reports

16297    You should ve explained to your dad that she was Indian and not black 
16298    Revenge for PS  early release
16299    But it totally makes game sense to take out Paul for Natalie  and not go after his comp beast partner Vic first 
16300    Well  it can t possibly be Nexon s fault 
16301    Apparently someone hasn t heard of the Mercedes F  team 
16302    Now you see me

16306    I d say they were his favorite punching bag after Fox 
16307    But isn t making as much money as possible no matter who s hurt the American way           
16308    clearly this is only because mcauliffe is trying to steal this election by letting felons vote 
16309    if you level them equally you are gonna be behind if you are wanting to do progressive raiding at the beginning  what i have seen most people doing wanting to do is have a main spec that is      artifact points ahead of OS so that catching up wouldn t be too brutal but you are still competitive when you are playing your main spec 
16310    Rusev will interfere  but Roman will just beat him down along with the other   men in the match and become the new Universal Champion UUUUAAAAAAAHHHHHH

16314    They are the same workers 
16315    With a safe zone they can build up as many troops as they need
16316    Wow  it s like they know  exactly  what we want 
16317    Um   I feel like you should put a spoiler warning 
16318    Maybe Game Theory was right 
16319    The writing is just recycled or rejected  Roast  jokes 
16320    Their logo reminds me of something   
16321    Obviously because anyone who wanted to experience something different in the one life they get is a lazy  stupid loser
16322    But One Piece isnt on until     
16323    Wooo  Sauropod 
16324    The lack of evidence is just evidence that something even more nefarious is going on 
16325    And then I caught a glitched Pokemon and it turned into a lvl    Ryhorn

16344    They released more than one song 
16345    what brand are the chinos 
16346    Oh yeah we should vote for the guy who has been involved in big money  corrupt politics his entire life just because he suddenly says he isn t beholden to anybody

16353    Everything that happens in nature is capitalism and private property  so any example you think of is analogous to a marketplace and private property norms 
16354    Asking the important questions

16372    I imagine they used rounded bricks to roll the quarried bricks into place 
16373    Yeah the Rangers should have done it earlier to give you more of an opportunity to retaliate

16406    confirmed GSP vs Mark Hunt UFC    
16407    It s clearly because I am throwing a tantrum over something that will generate Shark sales and for the benefit of seasoned players who need a long term goal

16421    Das racist though 
16422    I meant my question as in  Is it worth taking rapid breeder and pacifist to offset the research change  and  If so  do they make a noticeable difference that s worth a trait point    Your sarcasm contributed so much to the conversation 
16423    but the jesus imagery is more important than the actual superman and clark character  thank you zack snyder

16448    Because people who stay in don t ever try to do that and sell books and stuff 
16449    So you re saying we need a Scorpio S in order to do both 
16450    Yeah I hear the World Cup should have less teams so that the best teams had less competition

16460    I don t win the game when I put them in my squad  they re useless
16461    That seems like a perfectly rational response
16462    As someone who has only used Sass  it is by far the best
16463    He obviously just misses her
16464    Eh  he s got nothing on Tecatito
16465    It s not a game  it s an RNG prison we must overcome with EFFICIENCY  you filthy casual 
16466    Nah there s still hope for Bernie sanders

16479    That would be pretty shitty I guess
16480    Best part is   it s his GF   Obviously she s racist  and is only dating him to pretend like she s not 
16481    Cuz that guy directed it
16482    How I am with drugs rn
16483    The sound of a    gauge pump chambering is a pretty good motivator  but you have to be prepared to follow through  
16484    Yeah you re right she s a blonde woman  definitely fucks people to get anywhere  no other explanation 
16485    The same guys it s not China s fault
16486    One more instance of growing intolerance towards minorities in India

16488    But yet  we re not doing enough about gun crime  
16489    Wait a minute  you mean to tell me Boogie isn t a superstar but Ben Wallace is

16493    So    hacks then 
16494    Yeah  it s also very possible that she planned on attending it via video conferencing  which would require her time without having to necessarily travel 
16495    the fruit trees are different   you need   squares between each tree sapling 
16496    That s impossible on many levels 
16497    Wow  this was  so  necessary  thank you  OP 
16498    Doesn t matter  still copper

17642    So the side that wants to raise the minimum wage  expand the social safety net  improve access to healthcare  lower the costs of higher education  that supports the right to unionize  and which is critical of trade deals has ceded economic justice to Donald Trump   
17643    Yes 
17644    Chara does hate humanity  so not wanting to be a human makes sense 
17645    As other people in this thread have mentioned  India doesn t necessarily favor tall  they break even point on their happiness in   pop  which you should be getting in each city if you are going wide anyway

17682    rad 
17683    For my  hacky  way your radio would need a separate mic in where the port is the size of a standard audio jack If you have a cheap baofang you can see this  where the standard size audio plug is the mic in and the smaller one is the audio out Using the   pin would probably be unsafe to connect directly to the audio out or mic in on your computer

19206       
19207    But you re suing him in his professional capacity for negligence  which has nothing to do with what he says on his TV show

19209    Not really  I m leery going into a firefight below    bullets if I can avoid it 
19210    Regigigas should get anything  even something useless  if it means getting rid of Slow Start

19212    I haven t noticed 
19213    He did commercials for Comcast 
19214    You presume he has already been found guilty   cops are law  enforcement  not judge  jury  and executioner 
19215    ooo a whole      that s rough mate
19216    And most importantly he doesn t represent an existential threat to the  business as usual  establishment within the DNC 
19217    Unfortunately they re related to me  so unless they move far far away they re not going anywhere
19218    I would  but I m not a BernieBro 
19219    I guess there s no one right answer  but I certainly think the vast majority of people would rank Texas  Ohio State  USC  and Alabama ahead of Georgia
19220    Double penetration
19221    Fucking national treasure Dan brown story plot line right there 
19222    It s disrespectful to force students to take tests 
19223    He says he s paying off current debts  it sounds like the current situation is temporary 
19224    That s not how you spell Uruguay
19225    Typically you d want to use a flight stick in those games  no

19232    Well when they take   months to add a single hospital and an ATV  which is straight from Planetside  then yeah  its a little rediculous 
19233    Did you have to RMA it yet 
19234    I believe it 
19235    No man  it s a reporter who beats on the leafs in all their articles
19236    Yes  your example also shows that the word  voluntary  is pretty useless 
19237    nope  just kanthal   g
19238    Does she also say stuff like  I feel that you only do about     of the cleaning  and then deny your rebuff that    but I only make     of the mess  
19239    Meh  I care more about animals than people tbh 
19240    Its because it s not a set of rules to him  but a set of values 
19241    Yes  about Stefan 
19242    You re right  I was doing my math wrong 
19243    And all y all will get me one hundred gnatzi scalps taken from the heads of one hundred dead gnatzis
19244    It s been    years I believe which is still a respectable career
19245    And that s why this is a shitpost worth downvoting 
19246    Watch out dude  he s PC

19259    Why did you mention the widow is black 
19260    Look  once you have a number with that squiggly sign after it you can just make up whatever shit you want and people that believe it will defend it to the death even though they ve never seen any evidence that the number is meaningful or taken in context 
19261    Yea obviously he can afford it  I just think it s kinda funny imagining the man who co founded apple to be using a Windows desktop 
19262    Toucherception
19263    Hiko   Burger Spray 
19264    He straight up stinks  I think the Blazers have given up on trying to trade him  and would rather just get value out of Hendo  amp  to develop the young guys 
19265    The problem with socialism is when you run out of other people s money 
19266    Whoa dude I wonder why

19303     It s just how it works  
19304     ARE YOU KIDDING ME 
19305    I can usually figure out a shower in    seconds so the meme checks out

19314    No  no there hasn t 
19315    Delusion does not equate to legitimacy 
19316    You really should just email the person who disapproved them  going around them is kind of disrespectful and puts more work load on a great employee 
19317    Taking your words at face value  yes it is
19318    With Stan as the owner  the question is do the Colorado Rapids have a soul to begin with 
19319    Yeah  they don t equal it  they  cause  it 
19320    Or lease the apartment and be paid twice

19336    all of my keks
19337    Not racist but number one with racists 
19338    It s not much point arguing with you  but know that I love a majority of Sanders supporters yet identify a minority of them as Bernie Bros
19339    this would also be possible without the fabric
19340    It s so   appropriate  
19341    They will built it if Trump wins  American hordes will then be trying to get jobs in Mexico    
19342    secret papper ballot  electronic voting and counting is a cancer on democracy
19343    I was thinking that we pick Goff if we need a replacement for Gabbert very soon  but if we have     years we pick Wentz and develop him into a very good QB 
19344    Open relationship 
19345    What sent you down the path 
19346    Dude  the fact that you dont see how being able to level   things at the same time as selling power is telling a lot on how you ve been brain washed to accept this shit 
19347    Well  I mean  it already has a movie and the original creative team would be the ones directly involved 
19348    What s your point 
19349    Saving porn links
19350    The Mexican Government  Cartel  probably donated a bunch of fast a furious weapons to them too   
19351    But seriously this isn t a joking matter 
19352    You shut your whore mouth 
19353    The movie ending was better 
19354    Pretty sure they bought out a fighting game company to make them work on their next game 
19355    that kind of ruins the argument that the shield is useless
19356    Yea I agree every player in plat elo knows who you are and ghosts you
19357    Carson can t 
19358    It s not considered the media establishment now  it always has been the media establishment    It s in the heart of New York City

19364    He has said he is fine    multiple times    and that this was the smartest decision he s ever made  because the alternative was to quit pro play 
19365    Except they usually ended their sets with New York I Love You 
19366    I suppose it s fundamentally the same trick as breaking the bottom block of a gravel stack and immediately placing down a torch to remove the rest of the stack 
19367    You disgust me 
19368    Why not both
19369    Also both sides of the political spectrum would have to watch the show close to the same amount
19370    M lord
19371    You re officially that guy 
19372    Just for Brown and O Shea I do  might not have been the greatest Utd players but they were always decent  gave their all and never let us down

19411    People get confused by the fact that anglophones mispronounce it with a soft  c   and think it should be followed by an  e  
19412    Hope he got a five game misconduct
19413    Good enough  since it s the only point where he moves in the entire game anyways
19414    You need this explained like your   
19415    Revenue is revenue man

19430    There are  first world problems  and these  third world problems    
19431    Don t worry  there s nothing you can do 
19432    But   I was basically the one who turned this pairing into an actual thing in the first place  and I do deserve a little more respect for that 
19433    Donald Trump is a sexist because he treats women equally they should get special rights because theyre delicate innocent women duh

19442    Yeah  screw this guy for trying something without first considering his gym attire style points 
19443    Haha same problem
19444    That s one of the flaws of the OT

19447    Looks like it 
19448    Oops  sorry  I completely misread your question last night 
19449    Don t want to be over picky  but this is not grammar  it s vocabulary

19453     under   minutes is for causals  real pros do it in under    
19454    Changing repairing tracks in the field seems like it would need quite a bit of strength though 
19455    Why not use both 
19456    Hillary gets things done 
19457    Yeah  goddamn Arsenal fans  making every thread about Arsenal 
19458    But I think his point is why even risk playing it while you re winning 
19459    I m sure he knows that  he s complaining about a degree of DBG passiveness  not fact of hackers existence in PS  
19460    Wow  such an unusual move for a politician 
19461    You can practically taste the butthurt 
19462    Those bicyclists need to learn ATGATT 
19463    yeah  and the civil war wasn t about slavery  it was about  states  rights  
19464    Because a single party  authoritarian dictatorship controlling the means of production is totally true socialism
19465    I think it d be nice if there was a subtle sparkle on the legend or something that indicated available dodge 
19466    CA is like that girl that dosen t like that I am a nice guy with superior intellect 
19467    agreed it also makes the instance pretty shit
19468    I really wish they d made new seasons of Stand Alone Complex instead of redesigning the characters and retreading some of the same ground in the Arise   should I call those movies 
19469    Freedom to own   other people   states rights 
19470    Under sniper fire 
19471    no idea

19474    At that point for me tali was dead and legion was my best friend I cried so hard when he sacrificed himself to save his people
19475    How much is that stack worth 
19476    I personally believe Good Mythical Morning is still doing pretty good
19477    It s after you turn on the power I believe
19478    Neck and mid pickup together and it gets very close to a standard P bass 
19479    I find the concept of paid services for a game you also pay subscription for pretty unreasonable 
19480    pretty sure he forgot a

19489    Beanie Babies
19490    Wow dude    its
19491    Yeah I m sure this will happen  just like people kicked me from groups for not having Blackwyrm gems or not having Valentine gem on all my characters 
19492    Because Fox doesn t want the Republicans to face a tough general election candidate like Bernie 
19493    It is still virtually uninhabitable
19494    There s a way to do this without anything fancy  just open the kick menu through the menu memorize the order of names  leave and come back and one name will be changed and that is the hacker
19495    Yeah  side by side racing sucks
19496    theories are just theories
19497    With a vengeance 
19498    And let the Warsaw Pact take control of the Bosporus 
19499    No one has better hair than The Donald
19500    I can respect that
19501    Whoever has the biggest boobs 
19502    no
19503    It s obviously because Americans are supposed to play Japanese games  not the other way around  amirite 
19504    Yeah  clearly they started at the end and recorded till the beginning 
19505    you forgot the
19506    More and more games seem to list an i  as their requirement because consoles have got   cores as well  and that s obviously the same  right 
19507    Dana looks like that dude in Workaholics and Pitch Perfect
19508    Couldn t he just regenerate and forego Melisandra 
19509    France obviously does not have enough of the poor downtrodden migrants from war torn shitholes who just want a better life
19510    These statistics are obviously racist 
19511    Vince Foster
19512    Yeah  I hear people tend to listen to you and respect your ideas when you  torment  them 
19513    DONT TOUCH MY CROCODILE
19514    You think you want free stuff but you don t 
19515    Everybody does it  people just want to hate on the Warriors

19518    how else are cops going to protect the streets from people sleeping in cars 
19519    Kappa
19520    Solid argument  are you a lawyer by any chance 
19521    then ANOTHER ONE 
19522    Except instead of a sling  this is more like getting into a fistfight with Goliath 
19523    Ah the good old days  when we sent countless men to die in coups 
19524    Yeah  should ve started booing when he got up and jogged off 
19525    If you can t hit the phones and you re interested in still helping  Facebanking is a quick option 
19526    Pff  no situational awareness  git gud
19527    But then how will we protect our country from the coming terrorist invasion

19541    He still used  THE SKIN   he shall be shunned anyways 
19542    You re right  it s not like Israel is one of the largest R amp D hubs in the world 
19543    Well  if they both have the Visa logo on them  you can use them the same 
19544    Definitely not a shill
19545    cabbage
19546    I feel more southern just reading this 
19547    So were you fun before or after you turned gay 
19548    Who ever said this was a solo game mode 
19549    But what about the Jordanian billionaire 
19550    Completely repugnant 
19551    De Gea Check Courtois is way better because they have more clean sheets 
19552    You d like that  wouldn t you you white cis scum
19553    Maybe a little less   granted I ve spent a lot of time cursing at the TV this season so I might not have been watching the audibles 
19554    hes only    man dont be so hard on him  hes got a lot to learn lol
19555    How drunk are you 
19556    Everyone has one  and yours is wrong 
19557      drive or everdrive    are better alternative if  as the runner said  the game lags less on a real n   
19558    He raised his hands  it was clean 
19559    Yeah  that kind of attitude really led to us having a healthy locker room for the last decade 
19560    But   i thought the team was better without him 
19561    BTW 
19562    You re my least favorite type of person
19563    Intangibles 
19564    I think there was supposed to be an
19565    Don t you know that everyone lives in the US 
19566    I m like     sure it s a   rock reference 
19567    Right   because adding a child to the mix has traditionally been the thing that always  saves  a relationship   
19568    Zeah is clearly making rc too easy of a skill
19569    I hear Anaheim is nice
19570    I really like the idea but I think it comes with an overhead of additional work to make the games really fit together
19571    Just wait til he reaches level    
19572    Is that made by Norse Projects 
19573    It s the future  obviously they re underwater thanks to rising sea levels 
19574     netBeans
19575    WUT 
19576    I ve heard that putting newspaper in them and setting them by the fridge is the fastest way to dry your boots  they could be ready for Bologna 
19577    I don t know  simple questions like that aren t hard for me to answer but I m not trying to justify aggression 
19578    It s cool guys  he feeds the chinese buy buying Apple products  it s cool 
19579    oh      uhh         that changes things    
19580    its because of the stones shirt    duh   
19581    Yes  its      Shitty Dubstep song       Shitty Dubstep song       The Black Keys   Howlin  For You    Shitty Dubstep song       Darude   Sandstorm    Shitty Dubstep song       Shitty Dubstep song       Metallica   Master of Puppets  only on occasion 
19582    Yeah or maybe it s a ploy by Reid to get back at Lurie for firing him 
19583        Tithing 
19584    That scrub Hopkins better step up his game next season 
19585    hold my beer   
19586    Pharmacist here  I just say fuck a lot  and get connected pretty quick
19587    The fact that you don t appreciate the depth of this picture really emphasises your artistic ignorance OP
19588    System  
19589    This whole thread is what s wrong with unions
19590    In attempts to rattle the Kenyan mooslim commie that Americans elected twice    obumbum
19591    those werent to the back of the head
19592    Back from the   dead   other game
19593    I hate it when companies only make    hp out of a    L
19594    well these winning drives include the regular season
19595    I m ok so long as they don t add DLC 
19596    lol I can t believe no one made their drowning guy backwards and instead just copied everyone else  what amateurs
19597    Maybe some further pension cuts would fix this 
19598    My eyes     I why would you link this OP 
19599    I m sure this would have been scheduled if Sanders wasn t leading in both states 
19600    I believe that GOT stands for Game of Twinks
19601    Looks like its time for Garoppolo Manning I
19602    Sure you can respond  you have a middle finger don t you 
19603    Should ve added the
19604    Yes  more of a power vacuum in Syria would help the situation so much just like it helped in Iraq 
19605    well  to be fair  obviously  Bernie supporters will be too busy marching in blizzards to remember to simply go to a caucus location
19606    And if MLK had that concealed carry permit  maybe he could ve shot his killer 
19607    What could possibly go wrong with this 
19608    You become a battering ram which is needed to break through a door for an EE step of Der Eisendrache 
19609    That scene was crazy good
19610    I mostly meant like his mannerisms
19611    I appreciate it sir    I was only doing my duty
19612    Uhh u forgot
19613    Some buds  stamps  and dude is gonna throw me like    of shard   gonna be a good time
19614    What is this from 
19615    Please do so 
19616    This is all Harper s fault 
19617    Nah let s rebuild
19618    Obviously all black people make the same music
19619    I didn t know that We The Best Store had such good prices 
19620    This is bullshit   you re oversimplifying a complex situation to the point where you re adding nothing to the discussion
19621    Yeah I know  the funny thing is that DH didn t even put it in their pic of info about the major because of that fact 
19622    Ah  but what if they re equal on a large disc instead 
19623    everyone has bad games come on
19624    Yeah dude he s literally Satan 
19625    Maybe the reason I m running low on them myself haha 
19626    Oh wow  I never noticed that Miracles plays Terminus 
19627    Because you re not having fun if you go to a tournament to win
19628    Because scissors are bad
19629    How dare you not speak American 
19630    Wow  you evil satan money whore  hold it 
19631    People shouldn t be locked up without a fair trial  this I believe  but I find it hard to act neutral towards someone accused of something like this since it s typically true 
19632    Typical college football defense
19633    Based on her other replies he was AWESOME 
19634    Not in Australian Aldi     hopefully in time though 
19635    This is  totally  the droid you were looking for
19636    Great now Bernie is in the pocket of PC Master Race  soon we ll be seeing legislation for government funded game design grants and manditory   fps on all games
19637    I think grifts should also drop bounty cache materials too
19638    You forgot to put
19639    Ben was so bad the receivers started throwing tds to themselves
19640    yeah  not identifying a ring right limits my ability to screencap a video and give an opinion
19641    But but didn t someone say he was going to pop that purity bubble Bernie has going 
19642    But London is the only place that matters 
19643    Hey  some guy broke a rule  everybody gets to kick his ass now 
19644    wtf is going on here 
19645    What trouble did Clayster stir up 
19646    much like how you said     he ment
19647    New England he has worked on our farm team for too long 
19648    yeah  people should listen to more real music  like immortal technique  metallica  twenty one pilots  and knife party
19649    Now read that backwards
19650    But isn t that basically what Lax was
19651    Yeah  that s a valid reason  suppprt for Bernie Sanders is why people have said this for    decades  
19652    Right  that s why super models are all manly buff women 
19653    Yeah  Amazon doesn t know what they re doing 
19654    They never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity   
19655    Yes they add to the hype
19656    Anubis and Neith God of burst damage and complete hard to play
19657    As demonstrated by every other Halo game 
19658    Yeah  rape is awesome dude
19659    But Democrats like unions  so clearly it can t be a real PAC 
19660    What an asshole 
19661    Pretty sure an ice bong is the coolest way to smoke bro
19662    We need McGovney up in there 
19663    Surely    to    s on her W will make her balanced
19664    Saying a comment poking fun at feminists and you re a dick  but joking about rape is fine 
19665    I also prefer stale cigarette smoke and body odor 
19666    Obviously these Latinos are owned by the big banks 
19667    Only need    votes
19668    or Merle 
19669    Yeah because it was online
19670    But I thought pitbulls were too vicious for kids
19671    And if you divide that  that s roughly      Soldiers for each Fort Defender 
19672    It was an implied
19673    personally I prefer cornered
19674    Aphrodite s Kiss
19675    yay first time ever i didnt buy     keys right when th promo came out
19676    But he had a shaved head and gold pants 
19677    What about Carson or kasich 
19678    I keep telling myself it s just dumb kids but maybe I m the one that s dumb  when they re literal angels 
19679    But Valve needs to suck Perfect World s dick or they might lose their asian revenue
19680    Maybe Sheldon Keefe can 
19681    what are you guys talking about these refs have been amazing
19682    Should have Kindl playing instead
19683    It s in a book case with a secret way of opening it 
19684    people actually do
19685    Goodell is a pervert and the whole scandal was just his way of getting to know Brady personally
19686    But hey  at least we weren t in debt  right
19687    On it
19688    Wow what a surprise 
19689    Don t diss Sbarro 
19690    WHY
19691    I m sure things will clear right up once Hydro One is privatized 
19692    Jesus Christ  Marie 
19693    But he s a Gryffindor  not a Ravenclaw 
19694    Well  this is obviously applicable to rape cases because adult women are as immature as   years 
19695    THIS IS THE PREDICTION THREAD  NOT THE HOPES AND DREAMS THREAD 
19696    Yes you re right and I might have the rarity wrong but I pulled a holo e tele
19697    Just in time 
19698    Deagle

19706    Get rid of Luma
19707    Yeah  pro bowl voting is such a strenuous activity that you can t comment on reddit at the same time 
19708    Can t though if your not Japanese
19709    No way it s all in how they re trained duh
19710    Yep  it was until   weeks left in last year that we got the worst tactic by the WWE of       claiming their ringside stairs weigh   tons 
19711    Less than    percent What more do you need 
19712    Because local time is always used everywhere in international affairs 
19713    White people can t be terrorists cause terrorism   the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims   brown people
19714    So  not in a USB drive 
19715    Afterwards  he asked for a receipt for a tax deduction 
19716    Hell we should just rebrand bitcoin as Coinbase   
19717    Checks and balances  brah 
19718    He forgot this 
19719    You get out of here with your logic and leave me to my pouty anger 
19720    Should have just left her there to die

19727    Oh sorry  I didn t know that in your country people don t know what paragraphs are  
19728    Must be true if some guy in the internet claims so  OP
19729    oh     this is the first time im seeing this
19730    So this is why nothing ever happens   
19731    But women who have sex with a lot of men are sluts 
19732    Well thank god ebola is help fight the war on overpopulation
19733    I went to Japanese prison to pick up these rare gems before it was cool 
19734    You have to shoot your teammates at twice in spawn for the ban to kick in  so you can kill one teammate with a   shot kill weapon only once in spawn 
19735    And he also made plays which won them teamfights against Origen 
19736    stop being sexist
19737    or is it the best 
19738    That policy probably doesn t account for reluctantly cooperating with cops that are willing to break the law 
19739    Just because there isn t a men s health site  doesn t mean that they don t care about men 
19740    Just reached him Fuck my life

19753    dont even give them that idea
19754    I was going to say that is the perfect cap for the weekend 
19755    You might also try remaking the game profile
19756    Why do people downvote it 
19757    It normally doesn t go hand in hand with growing population and improvements in literacy  infant mortality  and life expectancy as the palestenians have seen 
19758    Didn t they say they want to bring some of the darkscape changes to RS  PVP 
19759    Leo on a lonely night  Man  I sure wish I still had that warp spell I gave to Corn so he could conveniently warp to the other side of the continent and     oh wait     that doesn t happen in this path      Hinoka s in for a surprise tonight

19773    No USF s were too  paticularly before the CalliOP nerf
19774    wait no    hz support
19775    Probably a live rework from the maestro
19776    I ve never had that problem across my monitors  but I guess it depends on different things 
19777    What s equally as telling is that there has been no notable deficit reduction whatsoever in the Tories time in charge  since the recession ended    but they keep harping on about it as if they ll ever actually hit that surplus 
19778    Sadly  I think you re right 
19779    You can find it listed under imaretardthatcantlistentomyteammateswithoutgoingemotionalandmentallyillwithoutknowingthatsnotgoingtohappencuzmyteammatesarenicepeople in the options 
19780    Maybe he got a golden Bolf 
19781    To reiterate  they  are  working on it 
19782    He probably thought he was top mid 
19783    and Clinton is praised for the same thing  that he  made  a great economy  when he really lucked into it

19809    I m a single guy in his mid    s here    I don t think i m near the median

19932    WHAT A GUY
19933    These guys should just play the lottery instead of worrying about the bounty
19934    Prepare for trouble
19935    Or coming back from the bathroom looking at a broken camera and telling the team information about what the enemy team is doing 
19936    Your bot is broken 
19937    Maybe their persecution of witches is the only thing stopping evil magic taking over the middle east

19952    Anytime Darth Vader is around in the Tie Advanced   Public Enemy   Welcome to the Terrordome

19956    Everyone knows we don t discuss anything pass season      this video is a sham 
19957    Yeah they should just replace everything with dev textures
19958    It s just sad and worrying how you americans can only think of this in terms of money  and not in the atrocities YOUR country is bringing and allowing in the world in order to keep the money flowing and the big pockets full 
19959    What is the difference between those two  btw 
19960    Cuba didn t sell out when we were down

19962    Me too   
19963    Because he s entitled to it
19964    In regards to the partial  and knowing majority of players at least prior to this offseason  unsure if still same   We didn t want him anyways 
19965    Have you ever had a really big cat and been scared that he was going to eat you 
19966    No obviously the refs are helping the Warriors only
19967    Please don t kill Kevin Love  a lot of banana republic customers will be very sad

19975    Yea sure  and I trusted Alex Rodriguez when he said he didn t use PEDS 
19976      NoHeadphonesIsTheFuture

19992    Still  it s going to be shitty paper
19993    Typical Hollywood white washing
19994    Yeah beacuse lets just keep quiet about everything wrong about the world and hope it just fixes itself
19995    Man bun

19999    GTY 
20000    Yeah  freebeacon has really been shilling for Hillary

20010    Hail Hydra 
20011    How long before Riot tells OGN to stop using booths 
20012    Because Lulu was the factor in todays games right 
20013    But Castro killed     times more people than Hitler with his bare hands 
20014    should we start sending videos to the league 
20015    Because all Reddit users have wonderful and diverse opinions that shouldn t be suppressed 
20016    He s just a really good actor 
20017    Because tattoos are physically taxing 
20018    That stall          disgusting
20019    Ah the case of Saul Goodman vs Saud Badman
20020    Because people who play strategies that actually work are going against how the game is meant to be played 
20021    It s an inkling  from a game called Splatoon by Nintendo 
20022    you are the man
20023    Every poll so far today has left me more excited 
20024    What makes you think Microsoft would want to develop their app for Windows Phone

20038    Time to un retire and become a Plat Sniper  ha

20053    Obviously it is the fault of white men and the patriarchy somehow 
20054    If I was a bit tired before a night out I used to take a  power shower  to wake me up a bit 
20055    I love how headlines often over simplify the matter so that it sounds ridiculous to pay so much for the tuna 
20056    Is that one of those spoilers on the GTR that retract flush into the body 
20057    OMG 
20058    because the scars remind me that they are real
20059    This is CS GO no fun allowed 
20060    Why would being a former detective with ties to the local authorities  who was then led by God to the vehicle in question out of thousands of vehicles within    minutes of searching be suspicious 
20061    What a psycho if real 
20062    They will have to bring the shuttle out of retirement  then they could use the cargo Bay for filming and just throw some tarps up and you don t need to worry about the fluids 
20063    No but remember it was scarcely used and never a prominent phrase
20064    If you don t support the refugees you re a racist
20065    So that is why Obama left Kenya  he was deported for being a radical muslim
20066    I hope you guys talk about cyborg

20070    Nah  he impregnated his own mother with himself so he could sacrifice himself to himself as a loophole for his own rules  so I am golden  
20071    Fuck  I hate living in this shithole called Switzerland because of our guns 
20072    Hitler did nothing wrong 
20073    This  or just be a healer tank from day   
20074    Or in other words  I just want an excuse to feel superior  so I m going to forgo any chance to educate others by claiming it s not worth my time 
20075        is like the price of one mousepad from razor 
20076    Cool  now I can Netflix and Chill on the go 
20077    Hard to tell sometimes with ol  Ben 
20078    Why does the PA s race matter 
20079    Our lives  when the Great Brown Muslim Threat comes storming through our borders and kills us all 
20080    If Japan gave every one of their citizens guns  everyone there would be much safer 
20081    FeelsBadMan

20232    Secretary of State  the most powerful diplomat in the world  casually First Lady and senator as a bonus

20334    OP hasn t become cynical enough  so obviously they must be a new player  everyone knows all vet players are salty and cynical
20335    Yeah  it s their fault for not carrying their own gun for self defense 
20336    Of course the shittiest team in the history of baseball would have the shittiest fans in the history of baseball 
20337    If you re suggesting that you must be a crack smoking hood rat from Norfolk that wants to destroy VB s pristine oceanfront

20354    Williams thought it was unnecessary  because there wasn t any suspense 
20355    Hey hey hey  not everyone can create a presentation with the same finesse and artistry as Assy McGee
20356    OK I know I m literally Satan but I love them for gaming  I always seem to have the edge since the key physically doesn t have to move very far 
20357    But he was eating BDub s too
20358    That time of the week again
20359    Ref did not give a red card  must be a British conspiracy 
20360    It s called protectionism
20361    Maybe the biggest waste of time in the game   
20362    Well  I gave up the chance when I had it  but if you wanna contribute to the school  you should  but if you re one of those people who are anti social loners or have no friends in the council  I suggest you don t join
20363    Only criminals should be worried about their cars being hacked
20364    I think it was the help that mattered  not the choosing to help 
20365    Making sure he can be vice chancellor under Strache next term   
20366    Typical vegetarian couldnt have just told you only once 
20367    Cambodia 
20368    Once you ve played a long time and have all your runes and a lot of champions you notice it less  but no it s always a slow grind for IP 
20369    Yeah but TWO mountains 
20370    It s the only think that makes sense really  finding an upgrade for both w   and Misery is hard  especially given how much their consistency has improved 
20371    Yeah    only seems silly to newcomers
20372    Except he wasn t 
20373    Apparently I needed an
20374    Fun Fact  The      Yankees lost their first   games    then won     of     games   
20375    My guess is probably Wake or Grimes with that    speed lol 
20376    Why not  you know  give them the truth  the facts  and let them make an informed decision 
20377    Thanks to assholes like you we never will   
20378    Because if you had a little girl  you likely wouldn t want her exposed to someone s wang in a school bathroom 
20379    Haha yeah and spend most of your life on planes 
20380    This game looks amazing  but how small is the character you play as 
20381    But    minutes worth of ads when you re paying     bucks for a ticket  and more for those who choose to eat drink whatever  
20382    That would be a shame 
20383    Same here    why bring false information in an already shit slinging debate   
20384    Since when do we have to know what we re talking about to tell you pro s what to do 
20385    I live on the water and on foggy nights ships blow the fog horns in the bay and it keeps me up  I d like to place everyone s safety after my comfort as I feel I m a special little snowflake that needs his sleep 
20386    Online shopping could be her friend  but that s probably too efficient 
20387    I m willing to bet     states will be legalized by then  hopefully all of them
20388    Who would have thought that Islamic death cultist  barbaric  genocidal maniacs were Fascist   that came as a startling revelation 
20389    I hope this comment wasn t serious 
20390    Well it would take care of over population 
20391    Implying the city of Detroit can afford school buses   
20392    I ve seen kids have fun and giggle trying to stay standing as the bus moved 
20393    Yeah  its a corollary 
20394    I wish Elyse didn t fake being drunk
20395    Athletes thanking God after every win   amazing play they make comes to mind 
20396     x   leg press after squats and RDL s is straight murder and I cant tell if I love it or hate it
20397    To expand  it s more along the lines of bouncing back a forth either frequently or doing so between alliances fighting each other 
20398    Drank  you dumb shit 
20399    you taint rape if it s a duck 
20400    To be fair  hematite isn t a jewel  its an ore of iron
20401    Or to avoid her own makeup getting messed up 
20402    Canada  they have free healthcare so I can get my head examined
20403    Nobody cares about aegis everyone attacks when its on

20406    Impressive collection of grass  but did you find the problem 
20407    nice try to increase your chances to get a juicy souvenir drop
20408     Even if it was  just a giant racist uprising its still a revolution     Just because you don t like it doesn t mean its not a revolution    These people are idiots
20409    Your plants have a nitrogen deficiency 
20410    Subarus were always lesbian cars 
20411    gay people ruin everything
20412    Stahp
20413    Freakin miners  they keep filling up blocks with spam instead of with worthy transactions 
20414      
20415    wow
20416    This is not a museum and I d be surprised if it qualified for your internship 
20417    What do you want to bet that he just can t wait to go bra or lingerie shopping with  the girls  
20418    Gros karma sur un text post   
20419    yeah jones looks slow  he s clearly done as a fighter
20420    Don t forget the     car following distance at   mph 
20421    Keep on insulting plants  creeper guy  and one day when walking through the forest you ll find yourself running out of oxygen while the trees around you laugh
20422    so thats why hes shouting vp he wants navi to win
20423    Nah  the flat pen helps way more with his damage
20424    Bullying people into watching your shitty prank channel ALWAYS works
20425    Yes  he should have used his pistol at the very least but still I can t justify the play in any way
20426    Yep  I m sure the media will pick this story right up
20427    Doesn t work for me  that trick allows me to sink the foundations but I still get the  out of range of a foundation   or whatever the message is  when trying to make a bigger platform 
20428    Mechanics too stronk
20429    Well  he does think all women are the same   
20430    if Hillary Clinton becomes president  I guarantee that it will be the last time a Clinton is elected to office 
20431    My point being that you can use compiz with any desktop environment  or even build your own session on compiz 
20432    Dat kan ik bevestigen    Mn broer en ik gebruiken regelmatig elkaars id s 
20433    That sounds a lot like the LDP s platform tbh
20434    but are your knees weak 
20435    I suppose it s not a  tax  effect per se but   island sanctuary   is a good   moat   imitation 
20436    Gives away too much of the movie
20437    Anything by Sunn O   
20438    Nah I live in a town and there was around       ballots with        people       census  We british luuuuv a good queue
20439    Plus you have to double what you buy to also add to DR 
20440    It s not high enough yet
20441    Well said 
20442    I m just watching the league community stream and the Elder Dragon gives your team     gold 
20443    Kinda feel like there should be a ND chip 
20444    I think it just means CBS  NBC  and NFLN each get five a piece 
20445    Hey anything is possible when Allah is on your side 
20446    sure looks that way
20447    it s gay to hang out with girls all afternoon holding them and doing stunts  let s go be superhetero and put our faces right next to sweaty ballsacks in the wrestling club instead 
20448    We re actually talking about Sonic Boom
20449    Perhaps it now counts as a higher value due to the achievement being reworked for WoD UBRS 
20450    the more the merrier

20454    This is my life now  I am dogphin
20455    I m just going to let you know something  I don t like you and I think you know why 
20456    Who needs to plant a bomb when you can just kill the entire enemy team
20457    Well a guy I know once downloaded Half Life   from Rapidshare and was super stoked about it until we broke the news to him
20458    Now we need someone to make a doc called Making a Masturbator 
20459    Dont worry they have gear score brackets     
20460    Damn  that was so polite he must be from Canada 
20461    It s only gay if you spitball afterward
20462    Doesn t matter if he s cheating  practice makes everyone better 
20463    You need MM 
20464    The part where she got paid too much money for it 
20465    OP isn t worthy of affection  he s a fucking white male 
20466    Yeah sure  just change your metabolism 
20467    Do I get all the money I donated to his campaign back if he looses 
20468    How do you prevent jaded from turning into bitter 
20469    Bold position to take 
20470    Because it wouldn t be equality if we constantly had to stick up for them  now would it 
20471     Spitefully Trust me  I Know Words
20472    Yea man  totally sucking his dick for having almost perfect cs in a  v  lane

20480    I m just giving you a hard time  love Giovannis too 
20481    Yeah other teams dont play double TP   dont use them better and dont know the current meta better than CLG
20482    Cat 
20483    But the person who created the English language chose those words because of the patriarchy  to oppress women 
20484    Sucks any time somebody surrendering gets shot  even if they were enemy 
20485    CLG was so on point for that last teamfight  so excited for MSI 
20486    really sketchy wiring 
20487    Omg animal abuse
20488    Idk maybe somebody for Colt McCoy 
20489    The human life can t run at more than    fps anyways 
20490    I forgot about the huge slave business in Europe
20491    I pay     for one in Pennsylvania
20492    Hundar for life
20493    Can I just identify as a female with my auto insurance to get the lower rate and still identify as male for my medical insurance 
20494    Jeej  wat wat leuk 
20495    And still he lived a great life  you ll never have      th of the success he did  and now he s dead so you can t even write him a nasty email 
20496    my exact response
20497    Chances are they will be  though obviously not soon 
20498    You miss      of the shots you don t take
20499    But the OP says it means less profits 
20500    No you re wrong that will never happen Trump is a waycist
20501    Launch date is april    right 
20502    You dropped this 
20503    That s the ocean   
20504    yay  more monopolies 
20505    These students sitting in the ground choosing not to leave totally had no way of resisting
20506    I bet this is      accurate 
20507    Yea just like Amazing s tweet
20508    I mostly listen to music when I m travelling and the signal is shitty so I d rather download everything and let it shuffle than manage a playlist
20509    Lol mechanically gifted Annie s
20510    They ve seized the means of production  post production if you will  long ago 
20511    Institutional Racism 
20512    Because they walk side by side  right 
20513    Should be fine 
20514    I m sure she needs a brass knuckle phone case
20515    The sculptor s hand slipped and his face ended up behind the mountain 
20516    And her name is Sony
20517    I ve always found that hilarious 
20518    Yeah that s it  every man who has ever turned her down was because they knew their dick was to small      it has nothing to do with their physical preference
20519    At least you have the Simpsons museum 
20520    Not sure why you are downvoted
20521    but the reality is that when Klefbom comes back from the IR  Hunt is headed back to Bakersfield 
20522    Because that is not how it was intended 
20523    There s still an NDA once you re done so they won t really be able to talk about it
20524     My  idea  at that 
20525    Yea it was fun punching that wolf for    mins at the start of bloodborne
20526    Sound logic
20527    So how do you know what percentage they represent 
20528    Dat end     p
20529    I have    mins on ps 
20530    Probably some shitlord that owned slaves and killed indigenous people 
20531    Spot on
20532    Scrape it off and pack a bowl 
20533    People like you are why I stop playing gta 
20534    Oh  thats even better
20535    If you weren t such a poor you d be able to hear the difference that gold makes 
20536    But it s all about the experience of freezing your ass off while paying a premium price to barely see stuff in the discomfort of a public crowded place
20537    Do you have any other links examples 
20538    Who s gonna care about two dead guys 
20539    I can t accept Bethany is alive  it would be ridiculous to misidentify yet another body
20540    Yeah lets give people jobs based on gender rather than merit and see where society goes 
20541    Cinematic gaming is the best gaming
20542    A first term Senator neglecting his elected office in order to campaign for POTUS       Something feels familiar about that  I just can t put my finger on it
20543    Tennessee Jed in long road trips my Dad  but Uncle John s Band was always my second favorite man 
20544    MP sell out 
20545    And I m positive lobbyists have nothing to do with that 
20546    The obvious answer is to increase the penalties to make all these greedy  hateful rethuglicans have no other option 
20547    Does anybody believe this 
20548    Yeah because large firms never steal money 
20549    These girls are racist bigots who have no compassion for other cultures 
20550    I am sure they don t want  x faster validation using secp   k 
20551    Noo   let him enjoy his vacation 
20552    What  you ve never had Nancy s 
20553    I d rather not talk about our backup qb

20957    Good  now the women who run away because they aren t allowed to drive have a better chance of reaching safety instead of being thrown in prison for having too much of their face showing 
20958    Yeh it s even worse that a one plus one got marshmallow before the plus   
20959    Well Surface has never had a removable battery in an effort to keep it as thin compact as possible  so that does align with the Surface line

20981    How many coaches working today have more than two NBA Finals appearances 
20982    Mine also died after   weeks    I ve noticed some failures and that s ok all devices have me but the reason it not for me is that my  li and dna    and even sig     and cube put me all at    w and the snow would doesn t FEEL lol     it feels like is lagging behind in watts
20983    I was taught to throw anything out that I ve had for more than   months for sanitary purposes

20999    Your friend has a built in charging station  so he beat you there 
21000    I guess it s time to find another outspoken feminist working for Nintendo and try to get her fired    What a great time in history for video games  the medium and its fans have really matured a lot 
21001    Enforcing that would be racist you bigot 
21002    You forgot the
21003    I recall getting an olive green color when I ate zero vegetables   and otherwise felt fine   
21004    especially because new profiles get shown to people a lot more than old profiles  so there d be a much higher chance of him seeing her first 
21005    All Canadians look the same anyway

21735    THANK GABEN
21736    Yes  because he totally has the power to do this 
21737    And startups that have  unique  names where a dotcom isn t available
21738    Lawsuits by people attacked by the  protesters 
21739    Just like WoW gold farmers   
21740    Does Trump really need to be asked to disavow the KKK every single day

21747    You are a doll if you truly believe this
21748    Putting gays   hippies and people with mental illnesses into camps and killing the disobedient is not something a murderer does 
21749    that is just shy of    k crystals to get it from    to     but  only     k to get it to       and that is about   day of farming crystals with this double weekend    but yeah  getting it to     isn t really where I want to spend my crystals atm

21760    Yeah your right the system REQUIREMENTS aren t that high everyone can afford to jump into this
21761    actually telefrags are easy    and that means she just cleaned up the fight similarly to illi getting all the kills once you try to back off from lost fight    what i ve got respect for is LM T bagging a back line squishy from flank with mirror ball seeker combo  as this is not as easy to hit as point and click tele on someone already dead    what I hate is that there are so many LM topping useless damage while not actually contributing much to team fight until it s already won   
21762    He easily caught up though 
21763    might actually let bridge be a good card in modern too   
21764    and yet the friendzone is not a real thing and is just man babies that feel entitled to women s bodies

21787    Aren t those all proportional states  which is probably even worse for Bernie than if they were WTA  
21788    He s paying himself with those plugs because his money is tied up with InBev 
21789    Free
21790    Because ladies are weak and inferior  so being referred to as a lady when you are a man is bad 
21791    It s better than level zero  redditor
21792    Right now  they re  ALL  letting Israel basically get away with anything   that s the problem    that  needs to stop   AIPAC is nothing but a bunch of spoiled lobbyist dicks  and Netanyahu    and because of religious reasons we won t go into for time  seem to get their way   but they can keep doing what they are doing for just so long before everybody else  even their own citizens  get tired of it

21896    No man that was Sunday

21910    On top of this  by the time you get to near endgame  I would consider sets of gears as they come with a fatigue bonus with a complete set  if your warriors use stamina heavily 
21911    Great value in this contract  who can we trade him for 
21912    Don t worry  no Gungans  only Gungeons 
21913    I thought he d be a majin buu or yajirobe fan
21914    I think that  in the specific situation OP has envisioned  one would step on their brakes so as to avoid rolling forward into traffic going through the intersection and thus being at high risk of a second  potentially worse collision 
21915    But I thought being overweight was considered attractive back then   
21916    Where ya gettin your protein op

21926    I just wish people would die at a time that is more convenient for me 
21927    Oh yeah  informing someone there is a better way of living is probably one of the worst things someone can do
21928    Weren t most pedophiles molested as a kid  you must be one for defending them

22012    Dude I want that necklace 
22013    Mark Hacking also lied about going to the U of U  GF may want to tread lightly 
22014    I don t think I ve ever bought from a concession stand 
22015    But it s ok  he only does it when the cat provokes him 
22016    Once we gave women rights and stopped hanging blacks its been nothing but soft pushover types

22023    lol
22024    Most of them are  moderates  
22025    I dunno  I think that maybe my friend who was raped by a German  and then denigrated by the German police when reporting it  might feel differently about some language groups having a monopoly on being rapist fuckheads 
22026    But he s  FeelinTheBern so he s alright in my book 
22027    Study hard and get a good job after college

22032    freeze mage midrange hunter
22033    Damn OSHA sucking all the joy out of the workplace
22034    More reason to shut out the rest of the world if they re that  explicative  liberal

22036    Parking pads for all  trees for none 
22037    Just accept your false accusations of being a pedophile 
22038    Zero is still plural   
22039    except it doesn t work  it only costs money and fucks up the middle east because we Westerners think we know what s best for the people there 
22040    Which one 
22041     Sigh  another brainwashed simpleton
22042    I think you re referring to S  Chinderpool  which is certainly not Chanderpaul at all
22043    He s openly racist and sexist and insults people  so he can t be part of the establishment 
22044    Got to add
22045    Never knew their was a Victorious Nidalee skin
22046    Sure  because the previous council members did not do anything at all for the community 
22047    Why would they name a cartridge    lotsa recoil if there is no recoil  unless they named it on opposite day
22048    Skyrim   Mel Gibson
22049    It seems like that would make stuff more likely to rupture 
22050    Why can t they eat chicken and cow like normal people
22051    Yes  it makes great sense to punish the dog for its owner s failings 
22052    Man  look at all these statistical anomalies that clearly don t pertain to a trend of behaviour 
22053    Inevitably  there will be suspensions and firings aplenty 
22054    Drop in the bucket 
22055    But when it gets full 
22056    Having a vagina is such an insult 
22057    Yeah  that s a weird way to spell anus 
22058    Stop perpetuating the sexism of the patriarchy

22063    They will end up splitting the delegates evenly 
22064    would be a real shame if consular support was unable to provide assistance 
22065    Yeah  but IIRC in the episode it looked like a tower  and my perception of the world is inherently better than everyone else s

22073    Bonus points for racism

22079    You re thinking of Seath
22080    Obviously you do not gain a huge amount of experience from the minigame  and you clearly do it out of fun  rather than for the non existant benefits 
22081    She s white so she must be racist 
22082    these votes in the state house how do you let that happen I imagine its hard to test under the inherited bill of rights      but that shit is bull

22105    Yeah because there has never just been a badly designed house or unnecessary dividing walls before

22157    This is why you shouldn t have friends 
22158    There s a neutral question 
22159    Have you considered dictating your response into a text to speech program and copy pasting it rather than typing it 
22160    They don t  look  like Africanized bees to me 
22161    pc gamign is too ezy  console are more challeging becuze teh framerate lowers wich adds challege 
22162    Ay papa 
22163    And not at all because of all the  moderate  Muslims that were seen celebrating the      attacks
22164    So bomb them 
22165    Just use the PM system on any forum  it stands for  private  message so nobody else will be able to read it 
22166    You re right  probably just a coincidence 
22167    Thank you for explaining the joke  I was lost there for a bit 
22168    Yeah the    y o CS fanboys are much better
22169    I m wondering too because I know there s one in long beach and it s not like it s hidden or anything 
22170    Who knew that rubbing sausages on your genitals prevented pregnancy 
22171    Because we allow them to exist 
22172    Yeah  it s not like you could expect UW Madison students to behave like responsible adults   that s just asking too much 
22173    But you ll die from smoking cigarettes anyway the cop is just shortening the time it takes to kill you 
22174    I agree

22207    I would have to say getting drunk and passing out in the bathroom of an Asian karaoke bar 
22208    Ember 
22209    That is pretty badass 
22210    What killed him IMHO was his plan to build a wall along the Canada US border

22698    QB  Brady  Rodgers  Rosenbager RB  Peterson  Bell  Forte WR  Brown  Jones  Hopkins 
22699    For sure  but I don t think he could top Vincent D Onofrio
22700    Clearly because we are a better team than Oregon and Arizona 
22701    Because the powers that be want them in Europe  or else they would not be there in the first place 
22702          
22703    To be fair  schools give you fuck all when it comes to having an idea of what you want to do

22708    She was stuck INSIDE the wall tho 
22709    A park with dinosaurs 
22710    Yes but when Google collects these big datas  they re not interested in the niche category of porn you look up on friday nights  they re interested in a trend of online behaviours that help predict disease outbreaks or environmental changes before scientists can 
22711    What s up with the negativity 
22712    My mom likes her toast cold  like she ll wait a minute after it comes out of the toaster 
22713    I don t even have a power armor left arm to repair 
22714    Okay  this is what we re going to do
22715    People who do this should do it in closed garages for as long as it takes to get the job done 
22716    The  HAMD roadmap  is in full swing I see
22717    You realize your title makes it seem like the fact she mischaracterized it is false  not her characterization   this sub   
22718    It won t blow your mind when you realize they don t take Arena into consideration when creating most cards 
22719    Yeah  people who complain about them  bitching at each other instead of fighting  probably don t even care about the character or franchise  poor they have a short attention span  in which case  may I suggest terminator Genesis 
22720    You been to a caucus before 
22721    like no one ever was
22722    Ping counts  not your up and down 
22723    threshold to lvl     gives the last of it needed

22735    Amen 
22736    How about only the nationalities of the players that have been to majors 
22737    I would consider what they re putting together in this film the  first team   while what we saw in First Class was more of a one off test run and DOFP was makeshift desperation 
22738    Of course  the cartoon had to make fun of Obama shedding tears once again 
22739    Second only to diagnosing strange noises coming from the engine compartment of your car 
22740    He needs to go back to mooching off Kim 
22741    I thought it was because he was Jewish

22743    Keep American jobs American 
22744    There are a shit ton of  leaked documents  out there but personally I m not getting my hopes up about anything until the devs put out a press release 
22745    Must be their male socialization 
22746    IMO the only reason they didn t repeat is because KG fucked up his knee 
22747     
22748    because Bungie s matchmaking is a complete joke
22749    I believe skyfog is the correct modern term  fog near the ground is landcloud

22773    Wheels are so expensive that I fear my sim racing career may be done once my dfgt goes    sigh
22774    I don t think that the point was to argue that China is doing better  but rather the the US isn t as great as it claims to be 
22775    Just don t shoot an empty netter from your own circle please 
22776    They re probably including in that figure future tax livestock revenue 
22777    Because Sanders hasn t mentioned it 
22778    Europeans 
22779

22789    They have both slipped through the net once in Eu 
22790    Don t hate the game  hate the dev
22791    But that  NEVER  happens     
22792    They re right next door to the Ponds Institute with all the people in lab coats 
22793    Well that sounds kind of sexist  so it can t be true  because reddit is    definitely not    sexist

22825    well thank you
22826    Looking forward to Hayden  dude has an incredible resume 
22827    Better than broken glass 
22828    It s kinda like if the Turing test and Poe s law had a baby 
22829    Don t judge his sexual preference 
22830    I thought he was going to shove something in it  so somehow this ended better than expected 
22831    Yeah  it worked real well with rabbits   
22832         is the year where they fix all their broken stuff and they had a meeting in Cyprus where everything was   solved  discussed   
22833      hz is soo good

22860    true because major news networks with millions of dollars never use youtube
22861    You can t be fucking serious   
22862    He could go to patriots and have a great season alongside other scrappy  white wide recievers
22863    Steel airplanes can t fly  or melt steel beams 
22864    Just like the SNP faded away
22865    No we plan to move off the coast of Australia
22866    Yeah because if you are bad you shouldn t have the right to enjoy having nice skins nor enjoy the game

22868    Too soon
22869    Chicken of the woods

22871       And they re fumbling for their clothes  but I ve already seen everything 
22872    A dota   player in the csgo area    
22873    Jones is not small  it was just a bad camera angle 
22874    So you re just going to act like the internet can t be used for education or profession 
22875    the boards of Boeing  Lockheed Martin   amp  General Dynamics probably
22876    What is the point of the autosave getting deleted when you load when the option to save on exit is there 
22877    Anyone got any info on zoology 
22878    He always knew he was a helicopter
22879    Real war footage obviously  the camera is actually a fly on the wall 
22880    That s what MLG gets for playing metal during downtime
22881    People already hate her and her butt in particular 
22882    Yeah  they re probably all heroin addicts and drunks
22883    Radfems would attack Blizzard s HQ so hard that they would wish to be stormed by ISIS instead 
22884    Australian server  ok guy we get your teammates are loading steam up
22885    Nice try MPD

22888    It s taught the correct way 
22889    If they re white and male it doesn t matter if they survived a concentration camp

22900    Yeah  I joke  but I never mind picking them up to be honest  electronics are a real pain to get at    
22901    and Taylor Hawkins and Woody Harrelson and Beck I think they ve got  just  enough star power to get in anywhere
22902    Bringing the bantz from down under
22903    They ve become as useful and old hat as anonymous

22923    Nuketown      so it might as well be cheating
22924    Sure poverty or other racial issues have nothing to do with that at all 
22925    Isn t this blatant discrimination against religious people and their right to blatantly discriminate against people

22955    Viper needs more boost imo 
22956    Ah yes  but the cast of all these shows hate Katie and thats why she was killed  
22957    And then c thun decks start running Nozdormu as anti patron tech card
22958      data points don t make a trend
22959    I m positive this guy didn t just hear about Kurusawa because someone told him the new Magnificent Seven remake is a remake of a Kurusoawa movie

23577    But it will be a capitalist that sells them the rope used to hang you    so capitalism kills amIright

23595    Let s stop mucking around and just place an alcohol interlock device on every car  at the owner s expense of course  if they want to keep their  privilege   
23596    But it also distracts me 
23597    Traps AND Mines have a chance to drop maps

24070    What could be more thug life than promoting gender equality 
24071    Luckily no one has smurfs for boosting up their friends 
24072    It s almost as if the major news outlets have something to gain by packaging tragedy and disaster into an appealing product 
24073    because it s harder to get prescription opiates  so people turn to heroin
24074    I see one that is super tacticool and three that are garbage 
24075    Shovels for shoveling catshit out of their  bathrooms  would be called poopy scoopies

24083    Good thing the Pope is on it because I m sure that more religion is just what this whole mess needs 
24084    Well the US is a Christian nation soo if it were true  he shouldnt be president 
24085    Maybe it s his homeworld being destroyed by Starkiller base 
24086    In fairness  who among us could withstand scrutiny of all the shit we do before that first cuppa coffee 
24087    So you re saying visa supports terrorism 
24088    At least you got to keep your doctor  right 
24089    Man  I love the stuff you put on here 
24090    ayy remember when we had    k

24095    Must be  moderate  Russians 
24096    Wow that s an amazing exchange rate
24097    No way bro that s every profession
24098    Just shows how a good owner can inspire his players    unlike that guy from Shark Tank 
24099    Rickie Fowler just keeps riding around in a jet until he has to go on
24100    A lot     a quality genocide  the key thing is commitment 
24101    Because noone ever would want to do that ofc
24102    Someone should probably tell him he s holing the Mag not the grip 
24103    I thought Thugs only referred to black guys 
24104    at least the game is fair now
24105    Because american autism is special as it comes from vaccines
24106    If you have to ask then you re a terrorist 
24107    That policy and type of thinking is working well for the US 
24108    Yeah I m sure none of the taxes we pay went towards their bail out 
24109    That s cuz the  ds is tiny as well so it averages it out
24110    I mean he his flair is global so     
24111    Apparently I did everything wrong when I visited here 
24112    OP Suspected of using clickbait links to gain internet points

24129      Portent comes up a        Today is the day I buy my wizard laboratory  
24130    As long as they give him enough time to blow a fragile horn a few times  I am okay with this 
24131      its relative and up to interpretation  
24132    This makes no sense

24200    right  but my point is that japan and some other asian countries should be seen as an exception of the  lower gun rate   lower suicide rate  due to the cultural differences whether thats success rate or just attempts is up to you  its an apples to oranges kinda thing  US should be compared to more western countries like the UK  Canada and Aus keep in mind i dont think higher gun availability means more people attempt to commit suicide

25248    Does Canada s government subsidize food the same way as America s government 
25249    Idk its like saying a attempted robbery should be unseen as he didnt actually manage to steal anything

25251    Or governments in general 
25252    Ah  thank you 
25253    Right because college and military are nothing but orgy fests where everyone gets laid all the time and there are no virgins anywhere
25254    Because official pvp has colored glass that doesn t shatter when you look at it 
25255    This is a today i thought i was awkward and not a fuck up
25256    Saying someone is salty is an unstoppable argument

25261    So far this season  Tamme has seen a bigger boost when Hankerson s out than White 
25262    because if you fudge the numbers well enough you can make anyhting  pass  its a game of rounding errors and decimals to drastically change the mechanical properties of materials in a model 
25263    What did you do  kill their girlfriends 
25264    I don t believe President Obama called you out right now on anything Rubio  so why do you keep bringing him up instead of answering direct criticism from Christie 
25265    At least it would give us that diversity we re looking for 
25266    A Kenny Miller hat trick comes close 
25267    I am Lucius  guardian of my bosom
25268    true  i mainly focused on her abilities since OP was talking about her scalings of her kit
25269    Because he knows there s no such thing
25270    What if you made a caricature of Bernie Sanders as a write in 
25271    Nobody spends money on edh
25272    Different opinions are offensive and a danger to this society 
25273    Oh no  don t be mistaken  they sold that car later that week 
25274    Everyone has the option of hiding income    particularly if you work in a business that deals heavily in cash

25287    That s a pretty funny joke  it could easily replacd inferno  atleast until inferno gets reworked with another entrance into b site 
25288    Honestly Desharnais and minny s  nd wouldn t be terrible to trade if we could get an alright winger   nd line 
25289    Maybe they will do a movie to connect it all and we will have Mary E  Winstead  The Cloverfield monster  T J Miller  Wade Wilson and Gypsy Danger teaming up to fight Thanos
25290          more syndicate rep per day 
25291    But then you go to the governor s mansion and gaze out at Russia and realize she s our only hope 
25292    I feel like  not going negative  is in relations to opponents in the race 
25293    Yeah  getting paid to do a job sounds like hell
25294    You are shit
25295    Daily mail 
25296    Someone disagrees with me  the only answer must be a vested interest in the other  bipartisan  side
25297    I too miss the days when Xbox exclusives weren t available on any Windows version

25301    I was triggered because this made me realize there are no fat health programs 
25302     waiting for a new thread stating that it was actually Diggle fans who did this 
25303    Apothicon Servant upgrade confirmed for supply drop
25304    Nikasaur killing phreak and replacing him  curing us of flanderization and bringing forth a new age of weekly quality fan art submissions  with added mspaint RP submissions 
25305    Oh but it s different if the dogs were  raised  to be meat 
25306    America is a big sickly grizzly bear that savages you every time you try to give it free healthcare 
25307    Here s to    more
25308    I think he wants the ability of insurance companies to have their plans extend across state lines   which would cause greater quality due to the increased competition

25322    Slave  kpop star  same thing pretty much 
25323    Right because cost of living in bumblefuck upstate NY is comparable to NYC

25325    huh  cool word
25326    To the front page

25331    hahahahahahfukhahaha
25332    Oh yes of course  that too  I didn t mean to be exclusive  D
25333    Not a big deal for our robotic army to eliminate this type of things

25335    please be finger s boat  please be finger s boat   please    yes I know it has already been identified 
25336    When you still want to see them or cant stop thinking about them even after having rubbed one out 
25337    Well for oral consumption it really doesn t matter if it is complexed with HPBCD  but for sublingual or buccal consumption HPBCD definitely helps the absorption 
25338    Se almeno una volta completata la scheda ti dessero un premio   
25339    Pretty sure he s hispanic  mate 
25340    It s all that homogeneity 
25341    You probably aren t actually eating  k   if you actually counted you would probably come in closer to      which is what it probably takes to maintain mass if you workout daily
25342    none of the goals were ugly so they deserved the win
25343    You forgot this 
25344    Yes  everyone gets an elimination thread with a    picture album of their fans tears 
25345    Then you attach a video link to their friends funeral and say  not a prank bro  in comic sans
25346    until you die
25347    Yeah man  calling bullshit on one transgendered person   transphobia  just like hating one gay person is homophobic and hating a black guy is racist and disagreeing with a woman is sexism 
25348    I think it d be feasible for it to be a child of Obi Wan and Satine that Obi Wan actually has no idea exists 
25349    Well they are spot on this issue  even if for the wrong reasons
25350    Still  if one can judge by the ptr leaderboards   wizards are the only dps in  man end game groups

25354    I wonder why MSM outlets aren t paying important stuff like this more attention 
25355    Duh bud  it s called Social Engineering 
25356    And no full faced helmet 
25357    Pornhub doesn t have      million 
25358    or if the whole thing isnt staged
25359    And spartans wore dreads so they have to poc 
25360    Well it started with some innocent dogs having fun   
25361    Welcome to the     club 
25362    This would be too complicated 
25363    They should just put a tax on corruption 
25364    The only reason I can think of is that they are here to ruin others  day or the game 
25365    You sure this video isn t fake  because it s literally impossible for the Mets to be good  don t you know last season never happened
25366    So you admit there s a link 
25367    Stop playing against Trick g in season   and   
25368    How can you argue with such big savings 
25369    I think the best thing Obama can do to support the stay campaign is to keep any  very candid  views to himself 
25370    Pretty sure Prisma Seer is whats really needed
25371    Found the Clippers fan
25372    I expected the most unbiased of opinions

25374    Because OP men ALWAYS want sex
25375    Yes  with the help of Allah we may get to witness another genocide of Jews in the region should Iran complete her goals 
25376    Why are you responding seriously to a comment that was  painfully obviously  just trying to keep the joke going

25398    He s just a kid  let him show up to work drunk like everybody else 
25399    Your issue is having high expectations for Krystal  or any fast food joint 
25400    Making fun of Hilary with a group of people that would never vote for Hilary is  totally  hurting her campaign 
25401    at least the prices to live next to crazy bums downtown are super reasonable

25610    Just make sure to get the ankles    
25611    Well  It s kindof an MRA issue because historical  oppression of women by men  is the assumption on which gender relations  both feminist and nonfeminist  is built upon

25660    Win    pre installed game recorder can record previous gameplay 
25661    If we did that  ISIS wouldn t be a threat as they are right now due to us usurping their ruling government

25694    Instead of people asking if it s worth it to shoot someone over property or self defense  why don t we ask if stealing something or entering with the intent to harm is worth getting shot  killed or maimed 
25695    Wonderful  I think our chances are slim  but Jack would be awesome to have 
25696    just buy a good wired mouse  and a cheap wireless mouse  so you can use the wireless mouse when  well what ever you need the distance for  and the wired one for playing games
25697    This raises an interesting question  wasn t that what you lot said about Miikko 
25698    Because no one could ever support trump seriously 
25699    I cri when my supports go Zeke s then play perma roamers or back line divers 
25700    I don t find raw dragonfruit to be particularly tasty either   
25701    Better to remain silent and thought a fool  than to speak out and remove all doubt
25702    Rogue penalties are too harsh 
25703    i don t even know what article you re talking about lmao george orwell was a piece of shit fuck him
25704    The fact that DEA NSA FBI are being so loud in demanding a back door is a MASSIVE endorsement of the iPhone security

25713    Well  obviously we can t deny that since you provided irrefutable proof 
25714    Sold them cheap knock off products rugs But really key terrorists rebels were believed to be there  idk probably not worth the civilian deaths and hate it breeds but I m not in the situation room so who knows
25715    but but  what about those ubiquitous laughing clubs 
25716    Is that a raincoat 
25717    Needs more flair 
25718    Cote is my favorite not the best but not horrible and not so well known fighter

25725    Being more akin to berries  that s not too far out 
25726    Gee  that guy is such a rip off of Pyrocynical  who is just a fake Leafy 
25727    Kinda like Superman on N   where all you do is fly  right

25739    But Curry barely plays because of the blow outs
25740    I have no idea what you re talking about  
25741    you absolutely can  in fractions of coin down to   decimal places  pretty much fractions of cents if you could find someone or someplace that would offer it 
25742    Came here to say this exact thing   
25743    That was a tap in so still no pure goal
25744    Clearly Tango is just biding his time  luring your child in to a false sense of security before he goes in for the kill 
25745    Fuck Seattle  amirite 
25746    It s all a HUGE CONSPIRACY 
25747    I would say   to    years of life expectancy 
25748    I agree  I was mostly venting as I didn t know they were retconned until I got into a debate about it with a friend because of Forward Unto Dawn

25758    This is what you get when you make a big issue out of manspreading 
25759     whoosh 
25760    We ll get used to
25761    Works fine for me 
25762    Yeh  sorry I get now why they are taking money 
25763    Agreed on most points but it seems immature to assume their work isn t strenuous 
25764    Well you quickly shifted from a single year to    years  which suggests that your original point to which I responded was  in fact  an exaggeration 
25765    ff de poes op de bak zetten
25766    It s HER turn 
25767    cool kid points

25770    Time to send him to a seminar
25771    You might be the first person to ever say that 
25772     Oh   they thought I was joking 
25773    i like the matte helmet
25774    np fam
25775    Yes  Amir Johnson s ankles fall into the  it all  category of things that Monta Ellis has 
25776    The Star Wars Holiday Special

25778    Pure bliss 
25779    Thanks NDP

25781    I don t like John Wayne anymore since he endorses Trump
25782    There s an inordinate amount of furries among Sonic fans as is  so when someone makes a Sonic game with sexual content it s certainly is just to weird everyone out and for laughs 
25783    Truer words have never been spoken 
25784    Yes it is
25785    He was a vegan and promoted animal rights 
25786    I thought holy was removed in MoP  huh TIL 
25787    Vijay seemed kinda sick too
25788    How can devs justify charging     in the first place when game development is so easy  anyway 
25789    Murder 
25790    It s not like every other team in Hockey east does that   
25791    Clearly it s an interview 
25792    I m sorry you forgot Reddit doesn t understand sarcasm without an
25793    If you re interested in people making assumptions about you as a person based on what team you root for  I d recommend the Rockets or Clippers 
25794    I can t believe you have to change some settings for this to work 
25795    Atleast Sea of Thieves is coming out soon
25796    So how long have you worked for the VA 
25797    Obese  sure

25801    How many homeless men are you willing to fuck 
25802    Nope  ray bans  so pretty much the same level of potential douche anyways 
25803      
25804    I think that is the idea of spacing out the leak
25805    Or place in shower clothed if you re really pressed for time 
25806    Only interview where I m thoroughly entertained lol
25807    Can confirm  Wollaston was literally Hunger Games 
25808    Boise 
25809    First ghostbusters now leatherface
25810    Wars have been fought for millennia  so sending truckloads of weapons into the middle East in     s couldn t possibly contribute to war 
25811    A richer person just called in 
25812    He s too old    Do you realize who he s replacing 
25813    The Clinton Foundation
25814    Lagbuster     confirmed
25815    Because if we don t mock those who are different from ourselves  how will we feel good about our empty  hollow lives  and all the dreams we gave up on 
25816    zsh
25817    Awesome  thanks bud 
25818    Wow dude never knew that 
25819    Worst part is traffic  other than that it looks typical

25831      GEORGE WASHINGTON  
25832          
25833    And all those paid speeches are for scolding sessions where she tells them what they need to stop doing to the middle class 
25834    They stop growing when they leave the factory  where they get fed silicon  gold  and other transistor friendly food minerals

25841    I have    left over  want some

25853    I see you have the Instagram filter border 
25854    How about converting them into housing for refugees 
25855    I m guessing you mean Lebron playing GM from the TT deal  which is another good point 
25856    It s all they have left  don t tax and redistribute that too 
25857    That s what successful people keep telling me 
25858    I was not at the game and have a day job  so that empirically proves yes  that is the case 
25859    Who cares about reload times when you never have to reload 
25860    That would be nice but I ll probably upgrade in a few months to keep up with the Jones  
25861    First rule of TIFU  everyone must pretend the story is true
25862    Stop hitting on her 
25863    The only reason we re here is because Antonio Brown was out
25864    Yep  that s all there was to Kung Fu Panda 
25865    Hey  at least the drug tests are free if you can pass them 
25866    The new companion will be played by Cheridan Zmif

25869    Umpires make like    k  a year  
25870    Neal Degras Tyson is an African American Hole Sucking the Fun Out of the Universe 
25871    Hahahaha  someone photoshopped eyes on trashbags again 
25872    still gotta wrap it when banging some strange   
25873    relevant username
25874    Another   ranks and you ll be in legend
25875    After playing that beta  I m definitely not getting rid of SWBF  any time soon 
25876    Most older COD games had a separate executable for the Singleplayer which didn t include VAC  but feel free to act like these cheaters are innocent  it s not like thousands of players have used FOV changers in both SP and MP without any issues 
25877    Yeah  no bandwagon at all on this sub 
25878    If by funny you mean interceptions in critical situations then you ll be happy
25879    I know where you re coming from  just do it with pre war money  you can still feel like a baller 
25880    RIP my sweet prince      lt   
25881    Damn        is pretty slow
25882    It s the hot hatchback version of a motorized bike 
25883    But the world cup is not till a few year 
25884    Jesus sees you  Jesus saws you 
25885    Well hey if he showers it wouldn t be aids infested right 
25886    Non il est mort 
25887    They do it for comfort
25888    All the job applications I ve seen require references immediately   
25889    don t leave me hangin 
25890    But mens feelings dont matter
25891    Any idea when this will be public 
25892    Compared to Fayyad  Abbas is an extremist 
25893    Wait  you mean to tell me things are out of my control 
25894    What about a bigger tank but I think at some point it would be impossible to have a big enough tank
25895    Hopefully no snow if Peyton is playing haha
25896    Peterson also can t be the best RB at   
25897    Nonono  muscly guys are clearly a male power fantasy
25898    nah its in french bruh
25899    Ex Machina and Inside Llewyn Davis are some of my favourite films of all time 
25900    What s the irony 
25901    Obviously feeling emotions and treating people like real fucking human beings is totally gay  which is also a bad thing 
25902       iPhones   gotta love them
25903    You sure you don t want the George Zimmermans of the world patrolling the streets 
25904    Ash with the RC  as my rifle 
25905    Yeah sorry  I think I just misinterpreted what you were saying and gave a kind pedantic response 
25906    OP  i think you should fuck your boss 
25907    It works for Phoenix Wright 
25908    maybe he just made a mistake 
25909    BUT I CAN NEVER FIND ANY ADVICE ANYWHERE 
25910    It is erasing potsexuals 
25911    Oh ya  there is a standing army in the Carolinas  ready to overthrow the US government 
25912    the dude above you is a FOOL
25913    If they run it like their NBA organization they will be relegated next split 
25914    you mean your laughing about my cannibalistic behaviors 
25915    first blood   the gold bonus he gets from it in this case 
25916    Yeah  because fuck him for trying to get acceptable performance from his phone  right 
25917    Bape
25918    Nice now we just need Piccaboo to go to Japan   
25919    Bah  everybody knows PFF ratings are complete BS  unless they are saying that person on my team is good  
25920    thornton and marleau
25921    Or  as I like to call them  UAs 
25922    junkie hipsters and meth head trailer trash we wont miss them in this world
25923    It s devve now
25924    Precisely what I mean 
25925    The internet also encourages the bubble effect  you can always find people who believe your crazy ideas and it is easy to dismiss anyone who disagrees 
25926    Standing there doing nothing until you re told what you re supposed to be doing usually works  or just go do angry dishes 
25927    She could probably throw faster than Haren

26037    You can use the generally accepted
26038    Anak Tuhan 
26039    You dropped the
26040    Which is why you build the fence on only one side 
26041    No  art 
26042    obviously for the people who haven t got to the part where they recruit sanji yet 
26043    Hey now  black violence doesn t count  and it s not terrorism when white people do it 
26044    Yeah its all America s fault
26045    Yeah I haven t hit    fps since I bought the damn game
26046    Honestly  if you don t see an image of a woman chained up like a dog  forced to wear a metal bikini while a pervert drools over her empowering  that sounds like a personal problem 
26047    If it wasn t for this being reposted every day I d never have seen it 
26048    All Lives Matter  except refugees of course

26054    Obviously he was radicalized because of the terrible treatment he got from DHS 
26055    Dont say this man  by saying this we are only proving his point 
26056    Ain t like nobody doesn t ever read those grammar books anyways
26057    speak for yourself  some of us are proud bulimics

26074    Oh I was so worried
26075    Well why do you think ISIS had so much control of there country  not because lack of training right    its because the men were in the kitchen while women were out fighting right

26082    Also he is    k less then wes   
26083    I agree  it would be nice but he is no upgrade 
26084    I think it s important to mention that the cost is only for the data  and does not include the charge for voice and text or any other charges 
26085    He s definitely the worst judge of  creepy  
26086    We still miss you Matty Mouls 
26087    It s good to hear a true conservative voice every now and then 
26088    It s utter nonsense 
26089    this comment is funnier next to a draven face for some reason
26090    Not much  P I don t see it being  too  hard though

26094    Worth it
26095    This guy is practicing writing articles for gameinformer
26096    crazy to think his last real win was   years ago and hes somehow swindled his way into a title shot while either Rory or Wonderboy are is gonna get knocked off in the process
26097    Since most of them still live with mom and spend all of their lunch money on weed  I am guessing it is a rather short hurdle to be considered  wealthy  by their standards 
26098    True
26099    I m too high for this   
26100    considering Ive never played FO  or   and dont know anybody who has  thats not very shocking
26101    No 
26102    Well unless he had a friend come In and confirm that a sexual assault did indeed happen  I m gonna have to not believe you

26122    Since the devs are RU  I would only assume RU 
26123    In America  the unemployed can t pay for the cost of a legal battle  so it s not a worry for companies 
26124    everyone lining up to coach that young team 
26125    We ll watch the April   th meme die when we find out it s actually coming out May   th
26126    If that were true Ted Cruz would ve been long dead 
26127    Shot Package  Aiming Down Sights narrows the spread of the projectiles
26128    Well they did receive the necessary military training from the USA
26129    I m pretty sure you didn t play Berseria  and completed it
26130    That s what they said about the cumbox 
26131    Reasonable comment  so by r nfl bylaws you were downvoted 
26132    So he can personally tell them how great bernie is 
26133    Florida has much different population density than Mass 
26134    Just because pretty much every economist agrees with Cruz doesn t make him right 
26135    Meanwhile  in Flint
26136    I don t want no taxes 
26137    So deep put her butt to sleep
26138    I believe what they re trying to say is that OP shouldn t let the boyfriends insecurities affect her professional life  ie  quit because he wants her to  
26139    You may need to delete him fully from your history or  in an extreme case  block his channel 
26140    And reddit is oblivous to sarcasm
26141    Trade verified 
26142    I blame myself when I miss my knife shots 
26143    It was gonna happen  Sooner  rather than later 
26144    You forgot to pluralize freight train 
26145    yes  this is basically everyone in the movement 
26146    Try me Ryan I will easily vote democrat 
26147    three words  wouldn t make a difference 
26148    Why won t someone think of the children 
26149    buuuuuuuuuuut she is all skillshots so how can she be easy 
26150    The fact that some people go out of their way to see Tom Papa tells you that democracy is a failed experiment 
26151    Requesting the gif of tate being critd by a bolting

26164    Mods please remove this crap

26166    When is sexual assault a gimmick 
26167    I know my SO isn t trying to hurt me  which is why I don t let it bother me  but every once in a while she gets a little too rough with it 
26168    You can flair his post for him now  rather than just reminding him to do it

26171    I should have seen this coming 
26172    They are still taking him to court via proxy  so they re probably still a little upset

26178    It also isn t the first piece 
26179    You are in the deer s backyard  not the other way around 
26180    Haha I remember finding out I could do this while doing Fremmenik Trials  too bad I didn t know about it at the beginning of the quest when you need to do the most walking   
26181    Take on a ride on     through lowell and andover and you might see why 
26182    One clogged nostril 
26183    Sperry is releasing them  and I am not buying them 
26184    Assuming your TV can play videos from a USB stick  yes  but you ll need to change the extension to  mp  to make it work 
26185    He probably won t sign either
26186    How could they have not tested it 
26187    When s the soonest plane ticket to Russia 
26188    A lot of well educated foreigners speak English at a level exceeding or near native speakers already 
26189    Isn t one of DDPs most famous videos on DDP yoga basically a war veteran who couldn t walk for shit and now he s just fine

26193    They can t even check whether the picture they re posting is   correct   it s not even a hidden bug 
26194    Pssshhhh  next you ll claim there s a difference between crony capitalism and anarcho capitalism 
26195    Haha income inequality 
26196    And RVD on Fb
26197    That may have something to do with boot camp training methods  where  if movies and TV are to be believed   soldiers are repeatedly told that they are worthless maggots by gruff but good hearted drill sergeants 
26198    Her face can be accurately described with the c  emoticon 
26199    Being born in a RICH family is 
26200    My honest opinion  LOL Literally  I will laugh at anyone who thinks or says that 
26201    Only thing I see confirmed here is your crybaby status 
26202    are you serious
26203    Don t forget your towel
26204    Don t adult too much
26205    Same here

26207    Quivered
26208    Nope  I reckon it s photoshopped
26209    Except I have found multiple Brahmin synths 
26210    Especially with the    year olds 
26211    Everywhere you go  Apple products are just for show 
26212    Gibson has potential to be in the Price Lundqvist category  though 
26213    I think that number is much higher than it needs to be  we should kill you for exaggerating the problem 
26214    Maybe I m just closed minded but if you want to play in a casual setting why would you play in a mode that is called  competitive  
26215    Dual wielding forks is very rich tradition 
26216    If you want to use anthems  use ones like Beastmaster Ascension or Coat of Arms that go big in value for the instant win 
26217    How you can be so gay 
26218        above average 
26219    Some pretty alternative wording and structure there  
26220    Sorry  my Dad is Benjamin Button and we re looking for pre schools for him 
26221    It s less than the cost of a new iPhone to get certified ffs
26222    In other words  it would be just like Brood War PvT 
26223    Ah well  it s Clinton  so no matter what she does   even if it s standard procedure   is wrong and for nefarious purposes 
26224    You are probably thinking of NuRavu  aka the Horsemen   Rocky   Dreamz   Lisi
26225    Yeah  because the votes of a select few on a subreddit are representative of most people in the country 
26226    How about the US put its military on hold for an hour and boom  problem solved 
26227    Source is literally in the article 
26228      score  
26229    I have not but I will soon 
26230    Right  that s why lots of their new comics are about the X Men  Wolverine  or Deadpool 
26231    But if everyone changes to the same tone you wont hear that siren
26232    You re just another example of a brain dead leftist 
26233    That is the most reasonable explanation I ve heard for the presence of the puppy 
26234    It means penis 
26235    whoosh
26236    The Chilling Tale of Freeze s inability to make the right choices in regard of picking teams  Also  he s making good money  but he got into the renegades really quickly in the off season    i m pretty sure more orgs would come along and pay the same amount he s getting    
26237    Or that dude who can t spell his own name 
26238    Boltcaster
26239    That and trying to enslave anyone they came in contact with 
26240    Yeah I think he s more likely to go to Milan or Chelsea
26241    I m starting to think that NK  really  has no idea what they re up against 
26242    You re trying to argue against the entire point of the   Watchmen   Good luck 
26243    Sucks
26244    If you wanna post me irl content maybe go to that subreddit 
26245    Is this one of the guys who use crutches to get more money without actually needing them 
26246    Yeah  I went through and completed all the predator missions   just that one Robin level spoiling the list 
26247    HOW DARE HE PASS A SLOW MOVING TRUCK IN THE FAST LANE
26248    Pretty sure Bernie s education plan will mean everyone gets to go to college for free and get paid to be there
26249    Do you want to play video games 
26250    Is that why he has a saint s name 
26251    Antisocial 
26252    Well  you could move all the homeless there and then when the flooding happens at least the homeless problem is solved

26275    If the computer knows what and where the problem is it should just fix it for me 
26276    I thought the chairman XI is firmly against corruption  this news must be fabricated to frame him

27327    Sounds like a perfect Speaker of the House to me 
27328    As chang e  I only use my   against minion camps  because I m a polite person and using it when someone decides to put effort on killing you is so ungrateful 
27329    Yeah  feeding live feeder rats to snakes is so inhumane 
27330    Hey  that s racist 
27331    Very true   
27332    I m glad he s so committed to the ideals of small government 
27333    Oh but less people are killed per attack with bladed weapons
27334    Well it s clear that you re not a real supporter then 
27335    Yes one burger every once in a while will kill you instantly
27336    That s why faker is so much better than everyone else  because he practiced only   champs

27350    The celebrity call ins for requests is one portion that s scripted
27351    And we have a winner  
27352    Probably because they ran out of lore for raid content and couldnt make anything up that was more confusing then WoD s story line
27353    Yeah let s downvote this guy for having a different opinion 
27354    There goes Chiarelli  screwing things up again and signing an unproven guy to a deal

27368    Your minds are just clouded by the inability to see the truth 
27369    Not smart enough to know if this is sarcasm or not

27412    Basically all governments say the same thing  You little children of Canada need big daddy government to protect you from the boogeymen that want to snatch you away in the night   keep this government in power or else you will suffer at the hands of the boogeyman  because we can t protect you any more  Fear is what most governments use as a tactic to keep themselves in power because it is effective 
27413    but toppling the stabilizing influence that keeps the country and surrounding region at peace has already worked perfectly in Libya  where the US got rid of Gaddafi   and in Iraq  where they cleaned out Saddam  and now those people are all free  and democratic  and rich  and stuff

27527    He flashed to auto Rengar but auto ed Lucian  that was the misplay

27589    I guess it wouldn t be an uncommon reaction for somebody who s still new and hasn t put any money in the game  since your opponent likely will have a lot of stuff you simply don t have  and it s quite boring losing just because your opponent s got better cards than you

28143    yes to other recording devices  works on my phone  and am checking about other things
28144    Glance down at the game benchmark section at that link and you ll notice that the difference in performance is non existent 
28145    Make a wall between Taiwan and China and have those dirty rapists pay for it themselves 
28146    Solid plan
28147    Accusing someone of calling someone else a murderer in a public forum when they ve done no such thing is a lot closer to slander than anything Simpson has done 
28148    If serving the public impedes on your ability to practice your religion then you should not be in the business of serving the public 
28149    The average human male also has less than two testicles  so this is in line with the broader data set

28168    i think i should hack now for a bit to improve game sense
28169    He said it s  a psychological condition   but given that it s just a made up word with no medical or scientific basis whatsoever  he s wrong 
28170    Ah yes cops should just wait til criminals are good and ready to be arrested 
28171    link karma is for srubs
28172    Yes that was the reason

28307    At least she didn t get raped and or murdered 
28308    And it s great to give someone who is meaning to kill you access to a lethal weapon too  isn t it 
28309    Yeah he s not insinuating ALL Mexicans are rapists  just most of them  and that s so much better

28382    Hillary is employing bots now 
28383    Oh  I forgot you could fly in raids

28402    I just love how we send them arms and money to support their apartheid regime 
28403    So hardcore

28405    Your perception of time is just clearly inferior  pleb

28426    No  this is Reddit  so it was  a brainwashing experience to get you to believe the most extremist and radical ideas 
28427    Yeah  border patrols harassing Americans far from the border and then tazing citizens when they get rightfully outraged sure is some top quality justice   
28428    because they were totally cheering that LeBron got hurt and not the charge call
28429    Yes  because Pokemon needs to never graphically evolve with the times and just cater directly to    s kid nostalgia 
28430    Fucking scrubs

28454    Only the ones from The Kansas City mob
28455    Yeah  if you want to be a headcase with access to guns  you d better sack up and join the military or police force

28470    Chicken   butter   nuts 
28471    Yeah but they re are no other designs for HBM  so it s unlikely there will be the volume to back lower the unit costs 
28472    That s the sonic the hedgehog child costume model 
28473    that was masterful 
28474    On top of the obvious ones Tiny    those buffs were good  his laning was his weakest phase due to lack of mana  like seriously  imagine a tiny  ogre lich lane

28528    I guess it depends on your dietary needs 
28529    Shitlords unite

28693    Yes  because cool people totally flaunt their sexual deviance in public 
28694    Or learning how to express it via text
28695    It doesnt but while were making assumptions about a guy we know nothing about we should at least assume multiple possibilities rather than just him being a pussy
28696    No  see  that s why they are great guides   they are always  really  intently looking for a way down 
28697    Certainly more than all those dangerous chemicals 
28698    Hope that s
28699    There s a reason they said the   th one is best   
28700    I m sure this will also be extended to accusing all  chan users of being CP distributors 
28701    I want aim down sights too 
28702    I think he forgot the
28703    FUCK YOU  SHILL 
28704    And extremely high cost of living  even by CA standards  wooo 
28705    There is no suggestion that Wonga acted unlawfully or   was aware it had left Sparham Price penniless   Oh  I m sure if they were aware they wouldn t have drained his account 
28706    And I bet that the reason the Fire Phone was a dud was because they didn t work hard enough 
28707    PSA has just decided to test Atonio as winger against Ireland 
28708    Gosh that sucks   it s so annoying when other people die and upset your travel plans

28717        Hopefully
28718    Oh yea  The Laugh Factory wouldn t exist if it wasn t for him 
28719    You have to wonder why they didn t warn these idiots 
28720    I bet they can solve the problem with a fence     clear a good spend money
28721    Wow wut do u hate the  nd amendment or sumthin u commie Obama lover
28722    Ah yes because the poor people will completely appreciate  more  cuts to their income
28723    Because Russia never tip toes on eggshells and offers the same diplomatic response to every single country in the world 
28724    Wickie pipe
28725    natural selection
28726    Obviously  we re all so spiritual now that we no longer need them 
28727    I don t know man  the current pope seems like a pretty cool dude who d be down for that kinda thing
28728    You would hope that s how it worked  but you see you can t be sexist against men  so you re wrong 
28729    Obviously they should have sold everything they had to buy food before attempting to take advantage of the social safety net
28730    Thanks for your contribution to the discussion 
28731    Sheep riding Sir Crocodile  Sheep is Luffy s real dad confirmed 
28732    We re just saving you some time 
28733    The problem is obviously you don t have enough guns

28751    Aren t  all  terms fabricated though 
28752    But  this year  is the year for Linux on the desktop 
28753    Great  let s preserve and worship it 
28754    The early      s after WWI  aka the   th century
28755    way to go Central America
28756    Until you realize how many jobs it s taking away
28757    Music to my ears 
28758    My life is pretty good right now  don t wanna hear whiners aka losers 
28759    Hey everyone  this guy needs more taxes to pay for us
28760    The world always needs ditch diggers
28761    It wasn t personal  just business 
28762    Come now  nothing s more true to country than having an obligatory rap verse in every fucking song 
28763    This reminds me of the Canadian Reform Alliance Party
28764    Thanks 
28765    who is the  our  in question 
28766    But    I can t read it in landscape mode 
28767    Yeh  fuck all the games before then 
28768    because women only date douchebags  or whatever redpillers call them   am I right 
28769    The baseball player 
28770    Good to see Blizzard is tackling the gold inflation problem 
28771    Yes  because saying abandoning Nazi Germany was a mistake may mean different things in different contexts 
28772    It s not small enough
28773    They should all get a participation medal for playing  so nobody feels like a loser 
28774    Yes lol   He has the newest aimbot that aims just in front of the enemy and then around him  to make it less obvious 
28775    Tim Duncan s influence is definitely showing through 
28776    Nope  build       is the final build 
28777    The AMCAR is a beast on DW when paired with the Low Profile suppressor 
28778    Wait what s a j k

28780    You really proved him wrong with that comeback 
28781    Why would you change things up when everything is going so well 
28782    Sorry I was getting on the karma train
28783    The tweets are true  and I ll make you retweet
28784    But    but Nintendo hates money 
28785    He probably has a huge ego because all he cares about is his body and health 
28786    omg first
28787    Did you win the war 
28788    Lyte confirms EUW EUNE is a toxic shithole

28797    What do people in Toronto not have computers 
28798    which is why jqLite is bundled with Angular  and directives provide a jqLite wrapped  element  in link functions  I presume 
28799    He said it so it must be true 
28800    Nah  I m sure that pulling the plug on their only game for     months wouldn t hurt their playerbase  revenues or their reputation in the slightest 
28801    Well that was brutal 
28802    i fucking loves wars 
28803    I think you forgot your
28804    Okay thanks I ve been wanting it but it s to much 
28805    But it took    years to make 
28806    Nah man  a legendary Pokemon that can mega evolve without the use of a megastone  completely balanced 
28807    You and me both 
28808    Pocket Gjally  They nerfed normal Gjally  so now they re just gonna make it a sidearm so people use it again
28809    Pssh  scrub forgot his power pot

28816    To steriods 
28817    Try putting milk and salt in it
28818    Yeah  let s put a cap on how successful someone can be  surely innovation and jobs will follow 
28819    Pour a large glass of it and politely debate the merits and shortcomings of the whisky  after a lengthy discussion he ll realise I m right   
28820    Yeah  who puts videos and pics of skydiving in a skydiving subreddit 
28821    Aww no they dun goofed Meg and Jackie are commin 
28822    So they weren t so bad after all 
28823    I hope Hitler senpai will notice me now
28824    Easy one star with your th in that corner
28825    Domestic abuse is  okay  
28826    But you only give the prisoners last gen consoles    ohh the unspeakable cruelty   
28827    Don t be silly  they protect ten times that amount 
28828    The Confederacy of Independent Systems
28829    Have you ever met a heroin user you d invite into your home and ask to babysit your children 
28830    But this kind of behavior is totally out of character for them 
28831    Well that explains why everyone is so mad that Japan and Europe are missing color variants of one of the most common amiibo 
28832    yeah because that s what blink is all about
28833    The twitch application has a audio only option
28834    This post is proudly sponsored by sony TM 
28835    Nope  you re totally unique in that regard probably 
28836    Yea man they hate us for sure
28837    Wait  what 
28838    You just don t understand the subtle genius of Nintendo  on this issue 
28839    What do you mean my FUPA doesn t arouse you
28840    But I thought all communists were Stalin loving monsters who want to invade America
28841    But Witcher   is so much better 
28842    but this guy is    years old  and it seems like he has  everything  figured out 
28843    Hindustani  Yehudi  Amreeki saazish
28844    Me too 
28845    Shhhh  those countries asked for it 
28846    No  I m sure they took the effort to block a million gaming sites individually 
28847    Solidarity feels 
28848    Yeah  god forbid someone likes posting frequently 
28849    They d pass gun control laws like Ronald Reagan did in California when Black Panthers rallied outside the state house 
28850    For the same reason PIO lurk on r india and call themselves Indians and criticize government they did not vote for  because they have no voting rights 
28851    They don t really take ideas from Reddit though  remember  they know better 
28852    Doesn t look like you thought much there
28853    They have attacked dams  bridges  trains  oil and gas pipelines The PKK sounds like quite an honorable group   
28854    But we see a maximum of   fps  we can t detect the difference of anything higher than that anyway
28855    Clearly his faith was not strong enough 
28856    I know right    It s Muslimese    jeez   
28857    Such an educated fellow you are
28858    God damn women these days  why don t they hate themselves and be completely submissive anymore 
28859    Guy on the left is stuck in black skinny jeans while his buddies have MC and ATACS FG  what a terrible way to go to war      
28860    It s still the current arc    but man it feels like this was years ago
28861    You forgot the
28862    Ah yes  modified Sonic    
28863    Rap music
28864    But the average person will obviously care about this and take it into consideration for their next phone purchase 
28865    From very independent sources   
28866    I forgot
28867    Lets make him go   inning each start so he gets a shot at ROTY next year 
28868    Like Ashton Kutcher
28869    Don t get us caught up in semantics 
28870    The hits just keep on coming for the conservatives 
28871    Well  if society didn t police men and enforce the paradigm that only skinny women are acceptable mates  men would be free to pursue relationships with the kinds of women they  really  want  curvy women 
28872    But they re not unpaid  they get all the cards for free
28873      Gramm  a  r
28874    Nah they re just immigrants nobody cares about them 
28875    It s only because Verizon is looking out for their customers  well being 
28876    I ll take it 
28877    Not if you stay hydrated
28878    To be fair  Buggy is a Shichibukai 
28879    It s Islamiphobic racist 
28880    But since you mentioned it   
28881     pretty sure  people like some show called Cowboy Bebop
28882    Black people are brown  brown people are tan  tan people are white  get with the program 
28883    Of course  lololol  is the best escape hatch ever  from any cringe you can imagine 
28884    How dare you objectify these builds
28885    Yeah  Whedon is      the reason why most of the characters are white  cisgendered  and heterosexual 
28886    Because people have never been wrongly convicted before  right 
28887    Oh there s your problem you re using a Mac 
28888    The Spurs 
28889    Your GPU isn t good enough 
28890    Yeah  I can t think of a single game that is focused on shooting white men 
28891    Because you ve met and talked with most modern feminists 
28892    You re less useful than Anne Frank s drum kit 
28893    Ever see a joke so bad it makes you verbally sigh 
28894    Just from the  title alone   I could tell this is going to be a measured  objective take on gaming  nerds and gender 
28895    Yeah man fuck checking your blind spot and making safe lane changes right 
28896    Right  learning it casually is much different than   oh well if I even want to get around in this city  order food I need to speak the language 
28897    Black skin is not a bug you racist 
28898    Tickets will not be sold for the Thanksgiving game in order to ban fans from Favre s retirement process 
28899    Devil worshiping  burning churches  eating babies  safe sex  drawing offensive comics  being lefty and such 
28900    These children are poorly trained 
28901    Because MY immersion and game experience is all that matters on this SSPOG  Small single player online game  so if I don t like your outfit I deserve to never see you again because getting offended at peoples appearance always is a good thing
28902    Right  because at this stage in the game they still deserve the benefit of the doubt
28903    Well that was worth a    year fight
28904    Leave it to a miner fan to be a bandwagoner since birth 
28905    Bbbbut  she s holding out for her      muscle bound handsome prince who will love her  cccuuurrvvvess  shitlord 
28906    STEP   BAN THE SCORPION
28907    yes it does  im silver   and I always carry but I get russians and its close game but im still silver   
28908    Yeah a    year old royal really know what the kids of today need
28909    And then  unless the dog has a stomach of steel  would spend the next few days with diarrhea  which is a  great  thing to deal with when away from home 
28910    This works 
28911    Darn  Really thought Clarkson had it in the bag 
28912    Did PFF just throw magnets of each team at a fridge and go with the order they stuck in 
28913    She could if she masturbated but she chooses not to 
28914    Bad grammar  would not bang 
28915    Shh bby it s ok
28916    Well  I don t claim to be an expert on the topic  but from what I understand  there have been some problems with Comcast and Time Warner having a near monopoly of the market  delivering shoddy service while a majority of Americans only have one internet service provider to choose from  so they can t switch 
28917    Time to hit  k MMR  brb 
28918    That s the beauty of capitalism  people like that will naturally bankrupt themselves out of the industry 
28919    If only Oklahoma was holding it when they played Texas this year 
28920    Yours
28921    Better than Claptrap  that s for sure 
28922    Thyroid
28923    NOPE     Wade  never forget 
28924    Lets replace ORBs with Br    randoms straight outta Koltyr 
28925    Nah  you re late because we have the worst fanbase in the nba
28926    War   War never changes
28927    Why not 
28928    This is how MH    went down 
28929    Sure  but if you were under suspicion of murder and the victim had died of a shotgun wound  you would prefer not to have any shotguns in your possession  right 
28930    I see no tucked in kitties here
28931    Yes there is  left to right is obviously a symbol of the West s decadent innovations 
28932    Just break your arms  dude
28933    You can t blame me for hating Jim because   I   breath through   MY   skin 
28934    Paint everything lime and pink
28935    The two go hand in hand 
28936    Landings must be tough  then 
28937    Yes 
28938    Where I am from  gun violence 
28939    I think cheated relationships can be salvaged but it s rare and in my opinion you both need to have atleast a   year break invoking a new relationship with new people and if you get back together after that maybe it can be salvaged 
28940     Feels  especially
28941    Even more ironically  the most clothed NSFW video I have seen is also one of the most disturbing 
28942    She ll endorse a few days a week before we vote or be chosen as VP  though I doubt the latter since she s said many times she wants to stay in the Senate  
28943    It s called  human capital flight  so while you may not wish to go  the phenomenon has been documented for well over a millenium 
28944    I think there was a story a while back about someone who accidentally brought a handgun onto a plane a D only found when unpacking later 
28945    Lol yes it is
28946    Damn it  Archer 
28947    wut The Army is practically the definition of the military 
28948    Same thing happened to me  but with packs  just send them a ticket and it should get fixed up
28949    Obesity is a lifestyle 
28950    A huge problem 
28951    I ll take it   
28952    Thanks 
28953    So basically we overclock and the body has to keep us cool  neat 
28954    K
28955    They don t taste half bad 
28956    Yeah who the fuck remembers specific occurrences of this 
28957    The elves with the red caps are the ones you need to worry about 
28958    i guess  no yeezys for him
28959    I have a nut allergy you insensitive prick
28960    The fact that Bledsoe wasn t invited makes me mad  but he s not really a big name 
28961    The thing to keep in mind about corner peeking is that scan pulse does the same thing but better 
28962    Isn t that background a shot from I  Robot 
28963    Aw  man  how cool would it have been to see AT ATs galloping like that 
28964    ZeRo is the only correct answer
28965    you can only purchase   each day
28966    Almost like there s different people with different opinions on Reddit   
28967    Va va voom 
28968    No  klopp lost a game  Liverpool are shite again
28969    Obviously fake  he has way too much legroom for it to be legit 
28970    Particularly in something crazy expensive like a  conda 
28971    So a populus remake 
28972    stupidity isnt evil
28973    You should say thank to G Bush for getting you into this mess since you enjoy occupation of such a barren land so much
28974    Boy  everyone s gonna love Dagashi Kashi  then   
28975    Brb preparing to take Le Toucan
28976    yeah  reddit hates mainstream I think    just look at what seasons they think are the best  not that I hate for example Gabon or Nicaragua  or even guetamala  people here are like  top    seasons  for every one of them   weird 
28977    Oh sure  I was just pointing out that what they technically asked for already happened 
28978    Thank you
28979    I always felt like in a Nolanverse  Robin Williams as The Ventriloquist would be dark and on par with Legers Joker 
28980    I never get tired of seeing this and i always smile when someone submits it  it really is brilliant 
28981    Hou Yi was released in season  
28982    Compare him to other true freshmen QBs in the PAC     historically  then get back to us with your apology 
28983    Stain catches diseases like they re pokemon 
28984    I know a multitude of PS  owners that never touched either and play the game at this very moment 
28985    I think it s great the AU Govt supports new tech and start ups    I have to wonder though  could this be interpreted as an endorsement by the Australian Prime Minister to invest in Bitcoin Group 
28986    I just used a million from my savings account
28987    Dare I say that is quite a racist reaction from that child 
28988    It s from this little movie called  Star Wars   you won t have heard of it
28989     Looks left and right for Sean Connery 
28990    Vescere Bracis Meis
28991     I just made my  first  purchase  first   first    first     first 
28992    Why do you want    month old toddlers buying guns 
28993    Desert Eagle   Naga FT           x Huntsman cases                CAD so       USD atm 
28994    How would I be able to make this a living desktop type thing on my Mac 
28995    What s the chance that the fatty is trying to keep the other one fat because she doesn t want to be the only fat ass 
28996    Baneposting IRL
28997    Obviously a census is a plot by Muslim terrorists to take over Nunavut 
28998    R u single XD
28999    I m afraid I just don t think that is the case with femme invisibility still being an active problem 
29000    yeah  they must be in the tradecraft 
29001    Well  it s not    that    funny 
29002    I am surrounded by idiots 
29003    This dude has more upside than jmatt
29004    Puff puff then we would pass
29005    Until your overclocks become unstable lol
29006    Yea he s done such good work with other eSports and hasn t had a negative impact at events 
29007    Dammn my guitar only has like   strings bruh 
29008    The part at the bottom of the watch that holds the sensors  as it gives the illusion of not making the watch seem like a circle  similar to a flat tyre 
29009    Taste like chicken
29010    Ya that volume is sure legit
29011    I half expected it on this thread 
29012    You dropped this 
29013    Thanks 
29014    Even if the charges were true  it would have been a real dumb reason for not listening
29015    I can see him morally opposing it due to a Kansas Christian upbringing  but obviously respecting others  decisions enough not to make a deal out of it 
29016    something something internalized misandry 
29017    He s saying there is no one with a bigger disparity between floor and ceiling
29018    That s so stupid too  many of the older  rednecks  probably wouldn t say that because a lot of them fought and bled alongside South Koreans during the Korean War 
29019    Yes you can t compare outright murder to a prisoner exchange at all 
29020    You d better not give away our secrets    Especially when I finish our scripted edition 
29021    SHUT UP CISGENDERED WHITE SCUM
29022     Bobbles head happily 
29023    You mean Righteous Slaughter
29024    Nawse made my day
29025    well obviously  protests are about the protesters and not about the problems

29570    hes quite a fucker  i played him every game and even when he was on     fitness he threatened to leave if he didnt get to play each and every game
29571    That s because he is a corporation 
29572    I can guarantee it isn t that  I finished and platinumed the game  got the Yharnam stone but FS wouldn t be as stupid as to make the unlock an optional item in a laborious  boring and extremely difficult part of the game that most players would never even get to  just to access PAYED DLC
