734    That is why we believe so many heinous things about people like Sanders 
735    Your previous comment didn t seem to indicate you actually hold that belief 
736    it does very slightly resemble the flag of the British Union of Fascists
737    If that s the case   Heller  is also void and you cannot have guns for personal or home defense

788    Considering many people were killed trying to escape I think it was a case of self defense 
789    I m sure the schools and services in Newark and Baltimore have been doing much better under their Democratic mayor  town council  and state legislature by comparison  right 
790    Snowden also exposed state secrets to foreign powers through  presumably  gross negligence 
791    Here we go again  vote manipulation   
792    And you ignored the  signd by  error on the agreement sheet      UNINSTALLED AND LEFT A NEGATIVE REVIEW  
793    Have you tried eclipse

796    I mean  one of his biggest supporters  Rudy Ghoulliani is a transvestite so I m sure he will be great for the gays 
797    Even when it s a close call people pull the  hey dumbass  card but I can dig what you re plantin fren
798    but the government is doing it  so its not bad
799    It d shift from short periods of chaos to somewhat longer periods of unstable order and it d go on like that until people found a system that seemed to fit for the most part 
800    To see if someone s brain can survive just being in a vat of fluid  and be fooled into thinking it was normal and had a human body and experience everything through a computer simulation

818    This is why New Zealand exists we use to export most of our food to them i m sure they will want our old trade deals back once they leave the EU 
819    So demonized Yuto to fuck with Shun Kaito and his demonized original form to fuck with Ray 
820    You could probably visit where the old TCU campus was

842    Exercising 
843    It s the difference between chopping down the tree and drying out the soil

851    I dream of turboing an Iron Duke in a    Tempest 
852    Massive Faraday cage around the whole country 
853    It isn t even a decision  more than half of the time the dash flings cupid so far out of position that the steroid is not worth being sandwiched between the front line and the back line
854    He s not your buddy guy 
855    Black beast in this ho

868    I need some context here
869    people have opinions you commie loser
870    The Catholic Church is literally Sauron
871    I think somebody started a rumor that Trump bought Disney
872    Sure  if Comey  Putin and Assange will do the same 
873    Collard Greenes 
874    but that document was clearly doctored    regardless  a guy with a name like Barack Hussein Obama is clearly the antichrist incarnate 
875    Congratulations  you just made the man delete his account 
876    Thats just pubic hair
877    winkyface must be the new

880    Of course  the Russians made your dog poop where he shouldn t as well
881    Skip to Pearl Islands
882    Only in the hands of those who are really good at initiating  otherwise i think it could be a really bad laning choice and will almost always give up the early push in lane and will have no pressure etc   But if you have someone like Mata playing alistar  then yes its defo pick or ban

899    clear enough to speculate  vague enough to frustrate   GG Capcom indeed  
900    Yes  but Europe is definitely socialist  right 
901    Follow my wife Follow I Follow my wife and I Follow my wife and    ME   
902    I agree with you in the sense of two things  I need the return of ribbons
903    Very willing

927    This is by far the edgiest post I ve ever read       
928    I really need to start using
929    Duh  it s called Nauru 
930    Pyongyang Times has some good insights
931    I feel like since they accidentally had the lootboxes show up on the xbox store that it s going to be quite soon  possibly even today 
932    Wow  never heard anyone mention that before here 
933    Do I need this to run Skyrim Special Edition 
934    Yeah  after all they wouldn t default a meme subreddit 
935    If they fixed it they d lose Korea though 
936    Japanland 
937    Good  now we need another geographical profile of this unsub
938    And mobile cancer tablets 
939    It s no news that Russia ignores other countries  merits due to political attitude  the USA due to cultural attitude 
940    It was love at first gun point to the head 
941    Nearly  bars and the like wouldn t be able to sell it  but otherwise  that seems to be the case 
942    I figured they would be expensive but where does it say the actual price 
943    Aw  come on  CA is very big 
944    headshooting using strafing is a pretty good technique actually  in most peek fights you dont do that much aiming  you see where the head is posisioned and then you strafe  you have peek advantage  if you go vs a guy that has already set your head height and he starts straffing i believe he will likely kill you since you are trying to correct head height every time
945    Thank you all 
946    the technology just isnt there yet
947    There s no  i  in denial

959    How dare you insult the glorious color buff
960    Buy it before hand since its legal  leave it sealed so you can get thru security  get a locker or use a friend s to keep it in the venue 
961    Can t wait to fuck up my dick
962    I would also recommend the awper to retreat towards T spawn  because if CTs will decide to save in the middle of rotation  they will most likely stay closer to their own spawn 
963    much much better to let the jobs leave 
964    There s a boot every half hour for the rest of the game  though 
965    I don t think it s fair to use dozens of comments made by conspiracy theorists to suggest that conspiracy theorists might like Jews  everyone knows that the conspiracy movement is about the truth not anti semitism 
966    If that s the only reason you re glad  you really need to get your priorities in order 
967    Have you tried being attractive 
968    Yeah  I had to turn the channel and I mean they just slo mo ed that flashing light thinking that people don t have epilepsy or something  smh

981    Cmon guys there are literally crazy people on this sub but this ones an obvious
982    Oh you can t call this out now  anti semitism is illegal

1019    Watch it now on YouTube in handy   minute installments 
1020    My guess would be that they are still going to go with Blackburn  but since UTC s football coach took the Richmond job then UTC needs him to hire a coach there first 
1021    How have we already forgotten the broken AP kog before Riot nerfed it     
1022    I never thought of holding a gun to a girls head until after she married me 
1023    Well  I mean  we can t have the voters thinking he DOESN T hate black people  now can we

1026    bully seminar incoming

1060    Pedophilia in the highest circles of government is impossible and has never happened before

1079    Luffy who is not on admiral level yet is getting the upper hand on big moms executive   and Jack is sleeping with the fishes after clashing with admirals Marco on the other hand managed to kick an admiral who possesses the power of light accros marine fold   block akainus attack and take a direct hit from garps fist   borsalinos lasers and still get up like it s fucking nothing Jozu with his diamond fruit and haki is probably close to invincible and this is just a speculation but could probably win against both jack and cracker as they are using brute force and weapons in combat rather then elemental attacks We don t know how strong ace is because he got beat by blackbeard who is probably the main antagonist so he has plot armor   his devil fruit is one of the strongest in the series

1093    But insisting someone fix something without offering a solution is one of out greatest past times 
1094    They re following me to work from Richmond obviously
1095    No  you are an illegal 
1096    Because they re brown and the Satanic West loves to oppress brown people 
1097    Oh  only       sounds like a bargain 
1098    Yes  north of portage is frightening 
1099    No silly  it s  a joke  
1100    But   but they should be free and Apple should swallow the costs of R amp D and manufacturing because I am mad about the lack of headphone ports and they should only please me 
1101    Totally vindicated 
1102    I too saw the video 
1103    I ve read them both  it wasn t a serious suggestion  but he wrapped up Wheel of Time quite nicely when it was out of control 
1104    Good to see Sony throwing money at the important third party exclusives
1105    I wouldn t have guessed from your username
1106    The estimate is         so it s roughly in that range 
1107    I don t see how you could have been late  three seconds isn t a very large amount of time 
1108    Well there s like ten people there so I m sure one odd comment at book club fueled that search 
1109    You re racist only when you re white 
1110    That s what they call their dad
1111    lol ya let him just wake up at    and try out for a professional sport
1112    Those people with the Trump signs risking people attacking them and damaging their property have more courage than apple ditching the headphone jack
1113    can I wear my hawks jersey when we play a central team 
1114    And clearly  rude gestures by some sailors  and  spying on a country  are on the same level
1115    Ahh yes rust is well known for being realistic
1116    AZAMI BEST DARK UNIT 
1117    Obviously Target s fault for her hurting herself by picking up a needle in the parking lot left by a drug addict
1118    but   but    but    it s a Christian school  it cant  be   
1119    This is madness 
1120    Because throwing thousands of dollars at the game will make you better than someone who has spent    
1121    You sound butthurt
1122    There is a Toronto BLM  they mostly just disrupt traffic and the pride parade  doing real important work
1123    I believe the EE song  Archangel  on Origins had a similar lyric top this
1124    DLC   has been announced as a PS  exclusive Despite feelings about the ending  This kind of made my day    How is this a fun fact  Sh t   Yeah they really helped out Haiti  not disappointed  this was exactly what I expected to be  They dedicated two blocks to this travesty  interviews are supposed to be informative  we re supposed to walk away knowing something we didn t know before  This interview didn t do that and it wasn t funny one bit  Trevor asked Bills opinion on three pointless pre approved topics  all this appearance was for was to make uniformed viewers believe that the Clintons are good people  that s why Bill bragged about helping Africa  they aren t good people    If I have learned anything because you have a cold you will be dead by the end of the day or you are already dead and your body double is now posting for you  the reaction to humans of new york makes me think so  she has the respect of tons of women  and men  because we all share a common experience  i cried in the shower this morning bc i have a stuffy nose so she has least has my sympathy vote    Yet another reason I will never eat crab  chicken or tuna salad  ever  Great  Now I have this image of the doctor brushing her teeth with it    Please tell me what other requirements there are to your rubric so that I can go investigate and send you my research  I m talking at rallies here where he is on his own  obviously a staged speech at the convention will be very thought out    But that would be rape  tap on the shoulder would ve sufficed     The pokemon anime is still going  Unpopular opinon  I don t care what happens with the anime as long as the games are good  anyone else feel the same  Based on recent trailers  SUMO will probably be the best in the series  A complex plot very out of place for Pokemon and more akin to JRPGs  alchemy  etc etc  make me think this  The games look amazing    glad to have you here Don t worry in a few days you won t have to think back that far   Oh but but but that doesn t mean you re not an iPhone fanboy     s    HTC m  g  v   s  note     Because they are only the best and greatest websites  right  North Korea Accidentally Lets World Access Its Internet And It Only Has    Websites   I ll give you    m if you figure it out I think Woox had something to do with Litt s ban      Nice choice of font for the tutorial Taking the perfect photograph in GTA V  xpost r gaming    This is an early      DaimlerChrysler car so technically it can use the badge  I can t put my finger on it  but this Mercedes looks a little off    id  They re here    Beating up white people equals solving racism obviously  BLM agitators strip man naked  beat  kick and drag him through a Charlotte  SC parking garage    Sure   with such an important issue you would certanily expect them to respond immediately    What an amazing response time from their customer service    I have a    GB Samsung Evo SSD will make it faster btw   well yes but those are cheaty pow lifting good morning squats Ya  I get it after getting into heavy back squats again    powerlifters are just doing weightlifting assistance exercises anyway Squat is an assistance exercise for her anyway       M more to break even   SuicideSquad stays in Top   for  th straight wknd  Ties  Deadpool for longest streak for any comic book pic this yr        M dom cume   Gotta fill that gender wage gap somehow  She s building a tax base to fund the rest of her life after her looks drop off a cliff    Obviously that s what I meant  Clinton won t get your vote because the DNC filed a motion to dismiss with a standard legal argument    Liberate the Doggoteriat  A must read for every comrade pupper and doggo    She s just brainwashed by the patriarchy  Oh yes they can  He s sexist because reasons  They won t let a little fact like his hiring a woman for a key position defeat the narrative    yes because hillary is the beacon of truth  she never lies   At first glance  you d think Trump  This is because he has a much higher false truth ratio than Clinton  However  the large majority of Trump supporters are not swayed by any negative results of fact checking  They trust him to figure it out when he gets there  and like him for his unfiltered rhetoric    I bet all her mom friends love her  she must be such an nice person to be around  If you don t get fat  everyone will hate you    haha thats hilarious Check the username    Yeah  it s totally made up Lol the Chinese boogeyman hysteria again    But the janitor does a shitty job of cleaning so we just get rid of him and then everyone will clean up after THEMSELVES  You say that like monopolies don t form regularly in unregulated markets  and as if the behavior and abuses of said monopolies are not the reasons we enacted regulations in the first place    nobody cares I was in the video of r    not to brag  now to wait til someone says nobody cares   I didn t know Zekt had brothers  Doge Frontier   Even more when they re ahead at the end of the game    The game thread is gonna get crowded when Arkansas is ahead in the  nd or  rd quarter    He hires the best people Then it s a gross miscalculation because women are a way bigger voting bloc than Cubans or charity wonks    How much are you asking for the champs NMDs  I have some of the Champs exclusive NMDs in size     Also have some Chalk UBs in      just to let you know    Na yo those are caves where mohammed did sacred islamic traditions the jews have no rights to it cause they just showed up in the   th century Caves in Which Jewish Revolt Rebels Hid From Romans      Years Ago Found in Galilee   Ha ha you saying this like DE ever intended to do a proper rework for Saryn and not a kneejerk nerf    Saryn s Spores should interact with all forms of Toxin Damage  Playing a lot of Saryn I ve run into a sort of wall  My weapon choice is always shoe horned into using a Gas Toxic build  Normally that wouldn t be a problem  unless you run into high level Grineer  Now my weapon is borderline useless against high level Heavy Grineer units and I m stuck waiting for my DOTs to finish it off  I propose that  like Toxin Gas      of the weapons Corrosive Viral damage is spread as Toxin damage amongst Saryn s Spores  This way players have more of a choice of what Damage type to bring to battle when playing as Saryn    Uncomfortable with the direction  aka landslide victory for trump
1125    Yeah  Allen s lacerated kidney last season should have been a red flag
1126    Probaly a laggy killcam  hitreg and other issues dont exist

1138    Totally agree  I was explaining his options primarily for the purposes of showing him why it was unlikely 
1139    Because putting yourself at risk for STD by hopping on every other dick you see and lowering those risks greatly by saving sex for a committed relationship are totally both disgusting worthy behaviors

1259    Yes  but it has a higher interest rate

1281    You can t understand Uganda culture
1282    It s snowing like shit downtown  wonder how many people show up to the game 
1283    More often than not  you get someone with no clue on how to play rein on your team  like the guy wastes his shield just standing in the open taking shots  doesn t call when fire striking  etc
1284    Yeah  go play with any of his card and take a massive power swing and miss

2835     Special snowflake  basically means  cis heterosexual white abled neurotypical males are the Default Humans and deviating too much from that is ridiculous 
2836    Probably from the locker room 
2837    It has a supressor

2871    The tattoo segment with the girl getting a cover up job     Gosh  it must be so terrible as a white person to be judged for something you choose to cover part of yourself with 
2872    Because Hillary Clinton is a  woman  and being against Hillary Clinton means being against  women 
2873    Why is this documentary not in the public domain

2879    I m working     as a PhD student while taking classes  but the good thing is i have no intellectual involvement I m just told what to do  exactly what to do  over    hour work days   days a week and my sundays I need to makeup any hours I spent in class in the lab    
2880    Trickle down economics definitely works

3121    That actually would be one helluva pull  Ice Rager would be even better though    
3122    Tuna

3124    Seeing as the YPG only aligns with the US in a common fight against ISIL and  as time goes on  they ve been aligning increasingly closer towards Russia and the SAA  the whole  American Imperialist peon  thing makes very little sense 
3125    Tbh  casual  rest only  puff dittos can get pretty fun 
3126    Missing out on D Bry vs Brock at WM   is always going to be my biggest dissapointment

3142    Arstotzka is greatest nation  comrade 
3143    Granted  people are  but I always notice the ones who leave to be old conservative uncles who start night clubs or liquor businesses in Miami

3151    Meanwhile  at the Legion of Doom   
3152    He was hydrated and wearing dry socks 
3153    Because this one of the few posts that wasn t talking about the specs and he still brought it into the thread 
3154    This is a  very  good question 
3155    Because it was a competitive  match 
3156    But we need less regulation  right 
3157    Look for me on tomorrows flair betting thread  we can settle the beef once and for all

3167    Obama tortures daily by dropping bombs on children in the middle east  stop painting the picture that we don t do this already 
3168    To be fair  none of those kills happened specifically because of picking IQ 
3169    Under    is classed as a young driver so technically I am lol
3170    Well Obama was born in Kenya so that s no longer an issue these days

3191    Good lord let me guess you are a part of the everyone gets a trophy generation who needs safe spaces 
3192    Seeing how powerful memes can be  not to mention the memes with frogs and gorillas  I don t see why not 
3193    What am I missing that s so frustrating here

3212    Assuming it s a  being  capable of vocal language I agree 
3213    So as a follow up  do old people start to have less ADH  and that s why they get up to pee   times a night 
3214    Hey if you look at the last two games we played  it s ALMOST like we won one of them

3217    yeah we should just do what they re doing in the Philippines and let people extrajudicially kill each other if they suspect them of drug use
3218    On the bright side  at least it s no longer millennials fault for voting for Stein or Johnson

4571    Wait  I thought walking infantry into MG is how this game should be played 
4572    Didn t they both play basketball tho 
4573    Couldn t have waited for the Switch  huh 
4574    Yeah  instead of going to war  just undercut them in all their exports in the international market  give subsidies to local competing industries and work on the logistics infrastructure for those industries

4598    God  kids these days don t dab like we used to
4599    Yes Trumps driver is totally a mercenary
4600    Might as well get rid of speed limits on roads  because people are already speeding every day 
4601    Maybe not going to college is where I went wrong 
4602    Ur meant to buy the parts with plat or trade with people who have other syndicates

4624    Just ask Obama to turn it off 
4625    Why not use a controller 
4626    I thought Kirk s guitar had wah pedal pickups 
4627    and got booted     
4628    But that s gay and gross
4629    Without knowing anything or even reading the article  Im going to take the side of the police  because they are honest  just  and could never do wrong 
4630    Yep  and people didn t hate Obama because he s black either 
4631    Does journalism teach differences in two  too  and to

4640    If I were to guess  you probably didn t max out inserter capacity bonus  which is expensive and very late game  When blue inserters are at   magazines per rotation  they definitely are good enough to handle behemoths 
4641    Well  considering the amount of cocaine he does    It is not surprising at all 
4642    I bet Dana waited a couple hours between clips just to get a reaction about UFC not promoting Nunes etc

4644    I mean I d totally let some random person off Reddit into my house

4680    High resolution but it can only see in    fps
4681    Great idea  let s just throw away    months of development because people didn t want the armor sets the way they were presented 
4682    Of course it would  everyone wants    minute grind fests each game 
4683    I mean  he s literally bipolar

4687    Nah  he s going to pick up Boze and Silly 
4688    I think it s the other way around  cold sores are oral herpes 
4689    But there would be less room for salty crucible posts or people complaining about balances
4690    I mean obviously was
4691    Nah  not worth 
4692    Just like a true leader should 
4693    I understand his issue tho  having to actually look  or stop to make a right hand turn would grind the city to a halt 
4694    Also  drug runners and smugglers know about boats Yeah  build a wall  that ll stop  em  sure thing 
4695    Have the courage to not be able to add an SD card

4699    No one drives on coronation drive anymore  there s too much traffic
4700    No this is great news  now the market system will be forced to increase wages to teachers and everything will be great 
4701    You just don t get it  Man 
4702    With such consistency as Voltorb  Jynx  and Muk it s easy
4703    The lads gone mental
4704      and Mics

4713    Wow aren t you a cool bean
4714    Given Pakistan s track record  the onus should really be on them to disprove their involvement 
4715    I m pretty sure CBJ makes up more than    of the league

4722    All of Eastern Europe is Russia
4723    She can be inferior  I just won t respect her
4724    MTGO is not a good client by any means  magic is really expensive  but Magic is a really amazing game 
4725    Shit Lets nerf him again
4726    Yea  I would suspect our military and economic power around the globe to collapse the moment he takes office
4727    Yeah but they do it for themselves

4755    Underwhelming Fuck off Gladys Knight is the shit 
4756    Wow those are some classy people
4757    When backtracking means slowly drifting through a minute and a half of tunnels and such  then it warrants attention from the devs cos that s a pretty shitty state to have a basic mission in 
4758    It says so in the news so This Time It s DifferentTM
4759    lets get a youtube hero to block them for us

4771    The we ll discover that the exploding batteries were somehow related to the processor  don t ask me how  when Galaxy A   s start exploding

4791    How dare anyone be in support of the stadium 
4792    Is it possible for her to be in the shadow cabinet without either being an elected MP or a peer 
4793    I guess It s a feature then 
4794    But that s not his intention  so it s okay 
4795    Yes Son 
4796    i guess he wasn t extreme enough
4797    But the courts don t have any authority over them 
4798    just a frog 
4799    They don t let no mere fact get in their way of the  truth  
4800    I think it s bad form to criticize the umpires in New York for making such a tough call
4801    The Poll is Rigged 
4802    Thank you though

4814    I mean they only call him Remy several times in the movie and nobody ever calls him Ratatouille  easy mistake 
4815    It was just a little pinch on the booty nothing to throw a flag over
4816    I was told the same about downtown Boston and it actually seems like it may have gotten better recently    definitely a little peeved about band    performance being so horrible at first though  and still not great

4916    Amazing Playlist   Thank you 
4917    Only if you re from Russia 
4918    Structure battle that is not a keepstar against that kind of super fleet is basically feed and lose or blue ball and lose 
4919    It s President Elect Trump you smark
4920    dead mem
4921    Why did this remind me of Arby n  the Chief 
4922    Same boat  not my thing 
4923    Well  we have a new Guerrero family member  so it could happen 
4924    In that case I think we are over estimating the speed of the average modern human s speed  
4925    No his opinion is wrong 
4926    Thanks  man 
4927    Shovels  we have hands for a reason 
4928    So does this mean that we can start hating on Zeke for voluntarily donating to Salvation Army because they re homophobic 
4929    Indeed they do but I mostly mean the DBS aliens resemble Amanto 
4930    Dumbasses are their core demographic   
4931    Making Krassie AN gives us a better shot at getting out the puppy killer
4932    Which McGee do we get today
4933    Oops I think I replied to the wrong comment  I agree with your point 
4934    Isn t that the case for most of us in the Prairies 
4935    You don t need to get your ear drum ruptured to get Tinnitus  that s not how it works    
4936    It s for mobile users
4937    Savage
4938    Only when I also take a dump 
4939    The meta is always changing and yes  ground is more versatile but air will make a comeback  even if it s short lived  you want to be prepared for it 
4940    When it comes to what side of the road  I don t really see a difference at all tbh 
4941    Thats true but i was referring to playing with your kids instead of parking them in front of spongebob for   hours 
4942    There needs to be an off option 
4943    If you re not as into ballpoint pens you could always look at getting the Pentel energel bl     it s an all aluminum pen that takes Pentel energel refills and they are by far the smoothest gel refills available 
4944    Yup
4945    You re assuming people would only want the convention minifigures to complete a collection 
4946    Even if it makes you feel an uncontrolable desire to punch whatever whoever is playing it 
4947    because I fed mine don t know why T T
4948    It would be a really big callout to the market if they couldn t 
4949    What time does it start 
4950    Awesome  but why no Baez or Hammel 
4951    you really don t think that they re going to split the carries between the two 
4952    And I tryyyy Oh my  gosh  do I try 
4953    Well the   times thing is a stretch 
4954    Yet when adults do that  they re told they have an alcohol problem  
4955    With that logic  Tranzit is our favorite map 
4956    As a general rule of thumb  the more important the issue is to large numbers of working people  the less interesting it is to corporate media You don t say   
4957    Fuck all of the everything for doing etc 
4958    I think she got sick from having to be so close to the odious presence of Trump  I m really worried about the debates now

4960    Pm site
4961    RieserFS would like to have a word with you   
4962    When I was in high school we convinced my gym teacher that basketball had a four point line  anything past half court 
4963    No  for sure  but your response implied something very different 
4964    I m sure the Trump campaign will graciously appreciate the subtlety 
4965    KDE inherited the Microsoft mindset  always aim higher than what people are using  so people need buy new hardware and thus contribute to a thriving ecosystem where everybody is happy  except for the user  
4966    May your Goop never slow this speedwreck enough  clever dragon

4971    BE THERE OR BE A CIRCLE  WAIT
4972    What else 
4973    Lol no one reads the articles  no fake news is consumed 
4974    California is so expensive to live in  though 
4975      votes for the price of one 
4976    God is dead and we killed him
4977    I see you are from the Haidtian School of Esoteric Memetics 
4978    You forgot the
4979    Ori shows up with her ball MIA and she has a Shaco on her team so what else could possibly be going on besides them about to fuck you with no lube
4980    Fascism is real and Trump is the leader of fascist America 
4981    Name means Pseudo wood  meaning it s not wood
4982    That s racist 
4983    I will probably draft something  and come back to it in a few days to make sure that I have completely thought it through 
4984    And free will doesn t exist so might as well reprogram the meat robot and get him to do something useful instead of wasting all the resources that kept it alive for so long 
4985    Wasn t that ship sunk even earlier in one of the walkaround flashes were he straight up said the feelings were unrequited 
4986    Maybe he ll become a city landmark like Angelo
4987    Finnish here  normal for us too 
4988    Ya because Republicans worked together with Democrats for the past   years
4989    Lmfao shut the fuck up
4990    You must be aware that your brother is by no means an accurate representation of the average social conservative 
4991    Insecurities uh    find a way 
4992    In an election which Bernie surely would have won 
4993    If DMX had access to the internet when he was like     
4994    Do it if you think it s safe to do so   
4995    All the lefties that decided to move to Canada because Trump won are starting to make themselves felt over there 
4996    Corner Gas 
4997    I might be blind or just too tired but I don t see your point here 
4998    Yes  because girls moan and squeal full throttle when masturbating with family in the house 
4999    As a troll response  actually he didn t win 
5000    I hate that there are two UTs
5001    Never said it did  I was talking about the old man who started the whole situation
5002    Whoosh
5003    His album is hotter tho 
5004    I always wanted another recession 
5005    Sure bro  sounds like a great deal and because I know nothing about supreme I m gonna assume you aren t trying to rip me off 
5006    Ofcourse it s legal 
5007       million years later 
5008    Haven t gotten it yet
5009    The snek told him to get fucked
5010    not       
5011    I loved the series but they don t do TV series  Stranger Things was a one off because of it s    s films vibe 
5012    No  everything is all the same  and it s white people s fault regardless 
5013    You just can t accept N  Fredbear was a girl this whole time  can t you 
5014    Why do you say that 
5015    in a decent society  people like this are shunned instead of party nominees
5016    Oh god please no
5017    Just broke three personal records    Most hastily achieved erection   Most savagely dashed hope   Most hastily lost erection Thanks for that  OP

5021    What s this crosshair 
5022    The day we invaded Iraq 
5023    not that bad better than most of the shit they  make 
5024    This games physics suck
5025    So   THAT   was the first FNaF  teaser 
5026    Unfortunately not 
5027    Won t it be a problem that he was born in Kenya 
5028    Yeah  I have a Zdeno Chara stick that is     flex  a foot and a half longer than stock  and is probably     thicker than a normal stick 
5029    BC quora bana diya
5030    add me
5031    Obviously baby boomers have a long history of never rioting
5032    In your case  you could rub one out in that time period 
5033    Are you sure he s not related to   out of   of the beach boys after initially being related to   out of the first   
5034    A team like splyce should pick him up seems really good
5035    Very attractive
5036    Slather on a bit more patchouli and the bear will realize that you re a friend
5037    Not enough calories for American standard   
5038    Imagine what he could ve been if he had a work ethic like Ronaldo
5039    Yaaasssss Don Carlos 
5040    But my upvotes and tired jokes 
5041    Of the top of my head conservation orders on areas of habitat even if they fall on private land  with compensation of course and or a grant system to encourage farmers to voluntarily preserve and maintain land that would otherwise be left go to scrub 
5042    On the other hand Tychus is almost always available which is skyrocketing my MMR 
5043    Neither is the    k they could have made if they rebought at   and sold at      
5044    Any better than the Detroit Little Caesar s 
5045    Enjoy those tears because soon enough after Ryan and his ilk fuck up SS  Medicare and the ACA even more  liberals are going to be drinking in yours 
5046    Yeah  it just sounds like the free market meant these jobs were just less viable without the government intervening and forcing these jobs to remain when the market obviously deems them inefficient
5047    How does a baby know how to use reddit 
5048    But then they just tell me   Not today 
5049    You are less likely to get yourself killed if you stay at home reading books  so it makes sense 
5050    Just give him a chance 
5051    It s probably mostly corn fillers  so it s technically a vegetarian sandwich 
5052    Yeah  which is a load of steaming BS 
5053    Yeah  barely better than war golem
5054    Not sweaty enough
5055    Apparently and it is the worst thing ever 
5056        yup that totally happened
5057    Same

5059    Sorry  not deep enough  it isn t hitting the top of this massive pot 
5060    Just making America great again 
5061    Yeah  the guy who won the Clio Cup this year and only missed out on last year s title due to bad luck totally lacks the pace 
5062    Literally every single year Lundqvist plays bad at the start and then becomes a god

5068    It s not dead it s just not alive
5069    And the article yesterday revealed from which floor he jumped from 
5070    Don t forget that it s Obama who was really racially divisive
5071    He looked a little like plastic in the last few games but is on point this year
5072    They mention Arin off the cuff about his new animation project 
5073    Are those Model Ms 
5074    It s a good thing you posted it on Reddit

5077    Chaosh is a laddah
5078    Lol this is some of the most selfish shit I ve read in a while 
5079    Still waiting for that one guy to post how it s a repost 
5080    I refer you to my original post 
5081    No  but we re masters of passive aggressiveness and fellating customers 
5082    Didn t school teach you that having your appearance validated by a stranger is the best thing in the entire world 
5083    re re re reeeeepooooost

5090    Well Pence wasn t running for President 
5091    Considering the way that counterfeiters are handling Reserve List cards  almost all of them are scary good  but can t be sold as  real  to a person who has ever actually seen a card from the era   Im honestly surprised  Chinese printing  Duals and LEDs aren t more prevalent 
5092    Winnibg olimpyc gold is like winning XFL championship
5093    NBK was the best support in world when playing that role
5094    Man I love Rancid  and pretty much all of their albums 
5095    That smile though   
5096    He should use         because         has issues that mess with online gameplay over wifi 
5097    But only shillary has echo chambers
5098    How many more votes would PRESIDENT Trump have if they recounted crooked Dem states 
5099    But they have a mandate to do as they wish

5101    Scouting grounds looked like a really chill environment wish we could see more    
5102    Yeah but then the truck might get scratched  that s why we have the trailer 
5103    But dude  what if T D users aren t actually assholes  and their posts have just been edited to make them look like assholes 
5104    HIGH ENERGY
5105    We refer to ours as Rosie the robot 
5106    That would probably have been better for them  honestly

5112    I can t believe this  a    year old could see how crooked all of this is yet the left is going about their business as if it s all okay 
5113    Oh  so they like to get freaky eh 
5114    Conker s Bad Fur Day from N  
5115    But it s wrong to vilify an entire group of people because of the actions of a person or an extremist subgroup of them  except if they re muslim or mexican  then it s OK 
5116    Agreed  just pointing out that it is possible  and I imagine it will become more common as time goes on  so eventually it won t be an issue 
5117    NY Times asking the really hard questions 
5118    I hope there s a scene with Tony Stark and Stephen Strange where someone says something like  No shit  Sherlock  and they both look at each other or something 
5119    I too judge entire groups of people based on what   person says 
5120    I just wish I could manage to score ONCE so I could finish off that damn quest

5131    So what you re saying is PSU needs that quality loss this weekend to sneak up into the number   spot 
5132    Fuck  I bet you feel stupid
5133    I wasn t aware that our behavior set the mold for every other advanced civilization
5134    A man worries that a woman won t suck his dick  but turns out she sucked    dicks in a row

5136    Well with the new Ottoman events  government type  the updated missions  I would give them another try

5139    I knew my glass botle soda habit would pay off 
5140    Grow home would make a fantastic VR game 
5141    Nothing  because I wouldn t have to work 
5142    Glad to see my home town San Antonio reppin  on the front page   
5143    Yeah  I expect we ll improve pretty dramatically on last year with a new coach and a  fingers crossed  better injury list  but based on those statistics I can t realistically see any other club being shit enough to fall below us on the ladder 
5144    I m expecting the Russos making a surprise appearance and showing the first hour of Infinity War
5145    No don t you see the paint tray 
5146    Because you need GeForce experience to use an Nvidia card
5147    It s like Alex Jones and Huffington Post had a disgusting love child
5148    This is a sub of tolerance 
5149    That would work except that some phones get rid of unneeded bands and more likely than not you will get a carrier locked bootloader

5208    The Keyblade Graveyard looks weird in this picture 
5209    Women amirite 
5210    Well they can also instead replace it with a built exilus which wouldnt feel like bad for most people  or they could just put      more on each potatoes Anyway  all I want is that they at least remove this shit   reward   and add a token system 
5211    I have contacted them  hopefully they allow me to raise the fee but that will probably require me to wait a couple days for the transaction to be cancelled first sadly  or possibly they can do the double thing with a higher fee to overtake the first one 
5212    But I thought the CIA was our friend now
5213    Deet

5443    No like I am by no means a hardcore gamer but this dude is always trying to tell me how I m playing this game wrong so I am going to prove that I know what I m doing
5444    It was always in the game  just at an occurrence rate which made it statistically impossible to get in any reasonable time  it s completely untrue to say it s only just been hotfixed in when it was technically available all along 
5445    Except the prequels did not have an unproven director and they were a huge commercial success 
5446    FO Mahonys would probably be your best bet if you go this route

6864    I could argue  arresting  somebody hasn t been shown to have any positive effect either 
6865    Well all the other responses are pretty       but I would go with Hoyer

8326    Yeah man  trash talking your own team when they re people you don t know personally  through a medium that does not convey inflection and connotation is generally a great idea 
8327    I heard he s russian

8907    Do you have any picture examples so I get a feel for how provative you are talking 
8908    If it quacks like a duck

8947    But Chrome is such a RAM hog
8948    Yea  I wish Tanner Glass was in the line up to stop hits like this

8956    Yes but he pulled the  birther  issue on a non white president cause of the color of his skin so that makes him racist 
8957    Yeah and shotguns weren t OP aswell and we just should have forced defenders to long range fights across the whole map   why are people so stupid and never tell those things to Ubisoft before they do nerfs 
8958    I hate the be the person that bitches about not getting free shit  but i just don t like the whole thing of them saying all these people are getting free stuff in chat but then it seems the whole xbox community gets nothing

9018    How very fucking racist of you  
9019    Of course the Patriots cheat again   
9020    Humans do too Source  puke when I m stressed
9021    Sure  he needs to take ownership of being abused 
9022    And yet with absolutely zero evidence against hillary and the clinton foundation  it somehow  raises questions and cast shadows 
9023    Yeah  lynching is at an all time high 
9024    Sounds like somebody s palace chase got denied

10552    riot isn t going to ban him if he doesn t do anything that is banworthy 
10553    If only I could do that when someone somewhere in the internet disagree with me 
10554    He calls himself a  college grad  in the title 
10555    I m not surprised you re so fucking lazy you can t figure it out yourself 
10556    How do those people hide the crazy allowing them to go on a date 
10557    What if it was supposed to be LOL  
10558    We had them but I was to busy playing   square 
10559    If we can t come up with effective forms of activism other than appealing to the establishment in its own courtrooms  we re  really  in trouble 
10560    I think we might all be confused by what you re looking for    doesn t most any high school have a track

10582    Thanks for making me laugh today hahahahha
10583    They lose intensity of flavor over time  but it s not like drinking expired milk 
10584    It s not a sim 
10585    yet NMS lack content more than most Early access well known titles xD
10586    Yes  but  bootstraps  
10587    since they gave it no camo i am totally not excited about it also changing   tanks that are so different without giving a free crew reskill is cheap moneygrab of wargaming
10588    I liked it  was hoping for a sequel  but it s been a couple of years now  I m not getting my hopes up 
10589    According to eurostat  they had        applications in the first five months of

10593     The King in the North
10594    Omg u ruined my day    
10595    That s the first thing that popped up into my head when I saw that idea too  as much as I like variation in maps  I do still prefer to keep the core mechanics in place 
10596    cry me a river 
10597    And by that do you mean they exclusively kill Filipinos or what 
10598     just as planned   right 
10599    I just bought apple     per kg 
10600    Just drink beer instead 
10601    How long what kind 
10602    It sounds like you probably need to call a professional  or do a lot more research 
10603    BUT DIDN T YOU KNOW PROMOTING OUR OWN COUNTRY FIRST IS TOTALLY LIKE HITLER AND HATEFUL
10604    Weird  I thought we were living in      
10605    Except for dx   games    Where the     currently works better   
10606    There is an artery on the right side that would be compressed by the fetus if the woman were to lie on that side 
10607    What are the odds that we can use modding tools to disable all the stupid hero powers and just make the game into a better looking Quake   
10608    Just like how almost all of California s population is centered around two major cities 
10609    As my Western counter parts say whenever there s a white supremacist killing rampage    let s wait for some more information before we jump to any conclusions   He could still have a political motivation  in particular Muslim immigrants coming to europe  like idol  Breveik 
10610    Yea we just shouldn t even bother since it probably won t work 
10611    If the  Best and the Brightest  made it illegal  who are we to oppose them 
10612    Because all soldiers are baby eating rapists  obvs 
10613    This takes things too far I don t know if my heart can handle it
10614    It s simple  if you can t fix everything at once why try and fix anything at all
10615    cheers 
10616    So you are saying the rest of us aren t getting the whole experience
10617    This comment is anti Polish  anti Catholic and made by communists
10618    Lolololol alright
10619    Lol
10620    Yes now that would be entertainment 
10621    No  only republicans are sexist 
10622    It s just going to swing back 
10623    But we already have that here
10624    Horror is my favorite genre  but most horror movies are mediocre to bad 
10625    I like her just because I know shes going to be a great main villain now that she s free of all that family and sanity that was holding her back 
10626    Well yeah  she hasn t gotten to the small pa roads yet 
10627    what about the lifetime hit of the SSD from re scanning files multiple times mindlessly 
10628    back out of HUT and go back in that s what I had to do 
10629    It started when we were younger you were my    
10630    Packages and the dream Cocytus 
10631    Yeah  completely reasonable that simply because they re not into you  they must not be into any men at all 
10632    we could have bought the entire newcastle team  waste of money 
10633    What s skype 
10634    That s because their wives weakened their family value when they turned    
10635    Spinning flax
10636    So in the end  going GTK  saves a bit  not because of GTK   it is actually heavier on a pr program basis  but a whole lot of other things  including not having both GTK  and GTK  loaded for  reasons   
10637    Like    no  it s not a joke  but I appreciate your helpful  and very useful response 
10638    I had those  Max Memory  cards with a weird shape so these were never useful for me   
10639    Yes because the best posters are always massive spoilers   
10640    Lol go away 
10641    Probably not 
10642    Or maybe they were pig kin  you disgusting otherkin phobe 
10643    I figured  that s still terrible   days    hours extra no one wants to go through
10644    My legs tensed up
10645    I think I  triggered  the person you replied to   
10646    fuck
10647    There is no such thing as too much Rick and Morty 
10648    Oh well  guess I have to fire up Modern Warfare   again
10649    Get some     alcohol and clean that bitch    just cleaned mine and it looks feels like I just bought it 
10650    yeah he killed an innocent gorilla just to save some kid
10651    I think we will need a new time unit shorter than attosecond soon to measure the amount of time needed for German State to be called racist after they will reveal those IQ test results
10652    So what was it 
10653    Nah  we need a recast barely younger than Star Wars Harrison Ford movie 
10654    We lost another one  boys    could have added another   XX to the ranks if it weren t for that damned infantry getting in our way 
10655    it probably took them an hour to write that tweet
10656    Quick cash grab       LUL 
10657        a primary semi auto  a shotgun  a sniper  a revolver  and sometimes a heavy weapon automatic gun
10658    The truth is so offensive 
10659    Rifts  
10660    I remember reading an article where someone from the Trump campaign essentially said that their goal is to keep Sanders supporters angry so they re less likely to vote for Clinton  since they know that very few will actually end up voting for Trump anyways 
10661    Still no problems on N 
10662    I sat through the whole two hour red nose special just to see the TWD cast last night 
10663    People shouldn t anoint him as the future  but there are a lot of reasonable people who feel he is at least a serviceable backup that won t kill the season like the guys last year 
10664    I have some snaps too  they look great but for people with normal to large heads they fit like shit  so shallow 
10665    No you see women are victims too in that situation because that s a result of society viewing women as weaker than men 
10666    Damn 
10667    As opposed to  uncovered Muslim girls who deserved it 
10668    Double majored in intemperative dance and liberal arts  am voting for Hillairy 
10669    don t play DR  or you ll wanna kill yourself all over again

10674    Yeah  I drank the koolaid for awhile   max level  the hard heroic raids  shunned any naysayers  then one day I woke up and realized God this game sucks 
10675    If firing through a closed door can be allowed to be called  self defense   why bother having a definition for murder at all 
10676    Something something sexuality spectrum more than two not binary blablabla nonsense
10677    Well  with this new bill  isn t it that as soon as a new substance hits the market  it  instantly  becomes schedule I

10716    In a game where they were expecting massive multiplayer space battles when that wasn t mentioned once and a game where exploration is the point less than an hour is no way you re actually going to start exploring properly 
10717    FWIW I had the same impression of the article 
10718    And simulor 
10719    BAH GAHD HE HAD A FAMILY
10720    Yes  being able to jump after a wallclimb was what was giving the top    of players a hard time against genji 
10721    Oh great  now we re REALLY gonna suck

10723    That seems like the rational response of an emotionally healthy adult 
10724    Op  get your money back It looks nothing like you And btw   if Sir Anthony Hopkins paints a picture of you  it s not a self portrait

10752    Why not Zeratu second skill instead 
10753    but but TI is the only dota event ever and its the only reason dota player out earn LoP
10754    This is why more people should watch NASCAR 
10755    Seems legit 
10756    It s Mexicans that are taking over the country 
10757    i hear SF has been looking for some OF depth

10761    GGG should listen to more people like you who don t play the game 
10762    Username checks out 
10763    Not sure they understand that states aren t winner take all
10764    Kewl    it s like the  Bull Pit  at Chuck E Cheese 
10765    Degenerate  weak  self hating liberals with no self identity beyond their shared hatred of all things normal

10778    fuk da polise
10779        Amen Break 
10780    He ll trade all the black guys he needs to to get him
10781     silently judges you while condescendingly posting about it 
10782    No   the vitamin D in the sunlight prevents DXM from properly metabolizing
10783    He s not really impaired if he s capable of capturing a raccoon 
10784    just retract them on final
10785    TIL  this is all Obama s fault and W was the best president ever 
10786    They must really hate ofw money 
10787    totally  games should only be decided by what cards are in your hand when the game starts  not what the cards do when they hit the board 
10788    Yeah because extra rooms and objects have absolutely no impact on the performance of the game whatsoever 
10789    but we need fewer regulations for our businesses and job creators
10790    Bone sharks and shockers seem to be affected as well
10791    Um Mitch you already promised your vote to Kelsey since she was a third wheel to get to the end   
10792    Laser pointer dot on the ceiling and human barking dubbed over is my guess

10794    Fallout  
10795    Something something Bush did     
10796    Backs statement up with absolutely zero data  how compelling

10802    Explain that this was inevitable 
10803    Are you sure it is the same        driver that he is using 
10804    I think you might have missed a few angles 
10805    More like   I ve spent whole day thinking on how to get that sweet ass karma on reddit  
10806    But drunks are just full of the Blood of Christ 
10807    Naw its gonna be the dinosaur plane just you wait and see
10808    That means it never happened  right

10814    yes a command economy dictatorship sounds good
10815    Looks like an old Gwinn Arms Bushmaster 
10816    Cultural freedom  we gotta respect their cultural right to raise terrorists 
10817    Is it because of the bathroom gender thing 
10818    This might be Danica s chance
10819    Oh  like that went so well the last time fire rained down on Tokyo

11163    Eh nothing a little duct tape can t fix
11164    It was also gilded 
11165    Yeah I can t imagine how this will immediately be massively abused 
11166    The LDP might retain their NSW seat  unfortunately  because they re ahead of the Libs in the NSW Senate ballot 
11167    Ryan Kent     y o u   winger 
11168    I don t care for the points either just thought it was funny if it was you 
11169    I think that this may genuinely be my favorite post on this sub to date
11170    Right  because ICE certainly never fucks up and deports a brown person just because they weren t carrying   different kinds of papers that day 
11171    I just might be crying harder    For my wallet of course
11172    this is a new and well thought out post
11173       but that s not important right now 
11174    Yup over      laps easy to get ahead in a high school type race where competition could be wide spread for such a long event 
11175    And I said I was theoretically studying physics  and boom they hired me 
11176    CERTIFIED DANK
11177    STAND BEHIND REINHARDT 
11178    OH GODDAMNIT 
11179         not racist enough
11180    So obviously if you do pull one from the tins you ll make your money back
11181    NAVI will not play 
11182    I don t even think I d watch football if not for fireman Ed or the barrel guy in the stands
11183    I ve had   copies of that damn Sigma thinking i d save a few bucks  But the auto focus on those lenes is horrible 
11184    r    fanart
11185    Shit     I could be comparing     years ago to now
11186    nah  i like having a very loose definition of pop music
11187    I m sorry   
11188    Well  if he had been around for the Eli trade  Manning s career would ve resembled Ryan Leaf s lol

11190    You can redirect the dragons if you ultimate as genji at the same time and slice them
11191    sicc grind  pupper
11192    no homo makes it fine
11193    In my opinion this is essentially directly supporting terrorism 
11194    They can barely keep electricity on in their country  let alone in the middle of the ocean 
11195    adderall
11196    But Trump isn t a fascist 
11197    It s just like multiplying negative numbers bro Melania is like the plagiarism Robin Hood  stealing from those who have stolen and giving it back to the people
11198    I think you mean from the left 
11199    To be fair  Jesus said the exact same thing 
11200    Until they re in the Finals  when KD disappears again
11201    It s those damn Amish again 
11202    So he is actually changing his tune about the EU to fight the even more extreme right from stealing his voter base    
11203    If by  the other Berserk figma s  you mean the rest of the god hand that appear on one of the pictures from the link you posted  unfortunately  I don t think they re out yet  just trying to save you some time  P
11204    How will you handle the server load from the traffic 
11205    Yeah  because players that will want to gamble will gamble anywhere they want 
11206    The Catholic Church shares it however 
11207    I love it when fledgling feminists feel that they re educated enough in the subject of their choosing  and decide to come forth to spread the gospel of Feminism and Racism caused only by white males  and no other people are at fault    Because anybody who isn t a white male is systematically marginalized and oppressed by the evil patriarchy that gives white men special powers and rights freedoms to commit whatever actions they want without consequences  because they re white men that are members of the patriarchy and force themselves upon every minority  person of color  LGBTQIALMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ member  and the rest of the special snowflake squad that I fail to name due to sheer laziness  and lack of motivation to do it 
11208    I caught one but the CP was nothing to shout about
11209    I laughed 
11210    He just wants to show off his expensive knife
11211    Well they need milk for a year before they switch to peanut butter and kool aid so there re not developing anymore then
11212    Your post has a grammar error  so not only can i not understand you at all  i also suspect you re inbred 
11213    Especially when his uncle is blood related and his aunt not   
11214    At least they aren t ruining Game of Thrones anymore  that d be ten times as horrible 
11215    And here I though I was perfectly OK and didn t have to wory about rushing things
11216    Yessss  going to be there this weekend 
11217    None of them were marked classified  so there was nothing illegal or unethical 
11218    Still sore about this years Stanley Cup 
11219    What about June 
11220    It s a big deal that it happened   it just wasn t fireworks to watch 
11221     Please  make a post about it  there s a chance some future fence sitter will see it and just maybe tick it off their list of reasons to have kids 
11222    I m so glad that what amounted to a temper tantrum in the brogressive movement because their feelings were hurt was not able to stop a female political leader 
11223    But then if you play what your team wants  who will cover  th attack hanzo 
11224    You disgust me
11225    Just stood there and broke his own neck i heard   
11226    So  you mean similarly to all the black people letting it all out when Obama was voted into office after      years of oppression 
11227    He didn t defraud people  only darkies
11228    Not really  poor wifi connection does
11229    That s why I ask my bagger to leave out   zucchini  they re basically the same thing 
11230    Hence why Americans are world famous to be the smartest people ever  impressing all other nations with their vast knowledge of geography and History for instance 
11231    Hey black hues matter 
11232    a good journalist covers all options 
11233    That s right people  if you don t believe Hillary murdered multiple people you re just a CTR shill 
11234    Extra emphasis on complete
11235    Seriously  some of the most loathable characters in this series are portrayed by the most talented actors actresses 
11236    You re so savage 
11237    But you are though 
11238    Is that a   gallon tank 
11239    He says  posting to Reddit 
11240    Lol ya  I m guessing based on the boots he is wearing that he isn t very high up and was able to walk there  but I hope he has atleast one other cam 
11241    I feel stupid but am I missing a reference here 
11242    I m mostly convinced this is fake based on how long the long the lightning lasts for it being such a quickly played time lapse 
11243    That guy should not have dogs
11244    Use Google
11245    man I hope CTR pays you enough for this
11246    you re annoying and ignorant
11247    B there or b square
11248    He doesn t even know what magazine it s from 
11249    Well  for the backend one can use anything  probably Rails or Django to stay  dynamic    I ll show myself out   
11250    Clearly  who would muddy that up with allegations that he s going to be given an acting gig 
11251    Because  even though Mark has clearly said not to do it a thousand times  they re still attempting to use WD   as a lubricant 
11252    the only thing not constrained by the blocksize limit is the size of greg maxwell and adam back egos  
11253    Well  this definitely was a solid alternative post to make
11254    First amendment motherfucker

11264    i m sorry but this must be one of the dumbest things i ve heard
11265    Woah  I didn t know Jack Black was one of the lost boys 
11266    The place that had ice cream
11267    How original 
11268    Large scale racism only exists when it s institutionalized
11269    I thought he was the next legend 
11270    it is impressive how fast he can dig with such small hands 
11271    This is why y all getting curved
11272    Oh he won t but you gotta believe him cuz he said he was masters 
11273    Assuming none of them dope already  and only the rest of world dopes those unethical heathens  
11274    When I unsubbed 
11275    Seems a bit harsh to call our entire military dumb   
11276    I thought heat rises
11277    And your inaccurate  uneducated and off the wall replies with no validated opinion are 
11278    Great idea 
11279    Because Thorin totally doesn t have an anti TSM bias 
11280    For a new player that must be a cake walk 
11281    Because the state government of TN is an independent woman that don t need no national tax to support her
11282    Every time 
11283    No one in my Facebook feed agrees with you so you re wrong 
11284    Np I like to see happy people

11286    He has got a lot of potential 
11287    What console  P
11288    A  Computing Teacher  should know that that s an example of recursion  not an infinite loop 
11289    Obama apparently  spends all his time hatching and executing evil plans that thwart the plans of true  patriotic Americans 
11290    Alliance favoritism as always  blizz 
11291    Looks like you forgot your
11292    I m shocked that a gym of all places would try to exploit it s patrons 
11293    Well color me surprised 
11294    Look at all the energy and excitement in the crowd 
11295    There have been rumors of that forever sadly   
11296    Damn I am angry now

11314    but you lifted    p   y  P
11315    Different countries  different politics  different funding models  different cultures  different tourism infrastructure  etc 
11316    should of just bought them from GE
11317    Still salty from the penalty Benteke won last season 
11318    Sounds like a really useful and respectful way to spend your time 
11319    So people can get exactly a pound obviously 
11320    Yeah but it sends a strong message for homeless people to top up their myki 
11321    nono  they are fans of nice walls  not ice walls 
11322    What s he whining about  I thought we had a Kenyan muslim as our president 
11323    Future Sight mechanics are said to not count as returning mechanics  so    maybe contraptions have a chance 
11324    Not sure what you re talking about  Eclise inarguably has the best pose in the game
11325    Is this lube 
11326    Trust me I know that feeling 
11327    I think option B fits in more accurately with the lore 
11328    We all know  Tom  was an experiment by Feige to create a real life Peter Parker
11329    Yup he had great timing as well 
11330    I ve heard of using a crab boiler for it  it s just a tripod single propane burner for using at the beach 
11331    yes  because the station platform is where I need wifi and not on the train itself while riding 
11332    Yes it is 
11333    That s not how the internet works grandpa 
11334    Maybe if they keep pretending there aren t any women in Gamergate  they ll magically disappear

11336    Oh man  I hope Trump gets the nomination so that BOTH candidates in the general election are planned parenthood supporters

11497    Hey now   
11498    I personally didn t like Wiig in the reboot  more so I thought her character didn t really have a point 
11499    Sky High
11500    Hearing about it everywhere  and bored with my usual forum 
11501    You gotta have   copies of that bad boy  in case one breaks from playing it so much 
11502    You re biased and deluded 
11503    No  he thinks you are an idiot because you are acting dumb 
11504    Nice 
11505    probably  but we should not ignore the words of the people who have already resigned due to this 
11506    timers and masterballs are individually more broken than gust gtfo

11517    This makes my head  hurt

11520    If we get enough muppets in one building we can start our own show 
11521    Just started reading Rothfuss and he s very good and I can t imagine anyone who loves Sanderson not loving the Kingkiller Chronicles

11523       who was it 
11524    Is that a reference to something or did you just come up with that 
11525    Generally I think it s because of girls getting a lot more matches than guys  this probably doesn t apply to this girl however 
11526    Death of a parent at s young age 
11527    Yes please 
11528    The Garber special 
11529    I don t think we re in any position to know the answers
11530    You forgot the Book of Mormon with the Bible 
11531    I m also guessing you don t wear a smock and get looked down on by the customers as  the help   but your point is well made 
11532    Yes it was
11533    Shit talk him all you want  but he had a better career sv  with the Leafs than Reimer  who people seem to think is a lot better because of a couple months last season

11553    yeah  but generally  they were either being yelled at or being lynched   
11554    My point wasn t whether he was right or wrong  but that he seems to have an axe to grind with Paradox and looks pretty friendly with the CEO of a competing studio 
11555    You mean a modified blue thunder bomb  Maggle 
11556    Gratz you will now be level      
11557    He needs to drop after June  th or he tarnishes his legacy 
11558    The amount of time and money spent to get any good return is diminishing compared to the    minutes I can spend grinding 
11559    you really need the
11560    because you need some sort of centralized state IMO in the transitional period  as a MLM  I believe the solution to corrupt bourgeoisie elements revisionists infiltrating the state is cultural revolution

11632    The fact that AMD was able to significantly increase performance in such a short amount of time only make it seem more likely that Nvidia messed with the code of the game to give terrible benchmarks for launch day

11634    You act as if you don t have RPDR on constanty in the background

11672     wow they are all anorexic 
11673    And the refs
11674    He was still unconscious at the time  and if the  ER keeps that vision from him it s easy for Bran to assume he simply fell 
11675    Haha yea bro forreal I ve just recently started getting into the sneaker game because I do have a job and stuff but still when your about to go spend it and you think about it like dam these shoes are worth like   long hard   hour shifts are they really that worth it  talk my self out of it nah I ll just save the money

11679    The people at the very  very bottom own most of the debt

11689    Is no one going to address the blatant cultural appropriation going on here 
11690    OP hasn t even given his opinion on it  but when you hate a product to the point of mental illness  reality tends to warp around you

11777    No its not representative of many demographics but it is representative of some which would suggest that it has damaged her reputation with at least the demographics and considering wider data isn t yet available it is reasonable to hypothesize that the damage is wider spread than the demographics reddit serves

11850    Out of all the comments I ve seen on reddit  this is the one that pierces my unfeeling exterior  and causes me to consider that the little people might actually qualify as human  too  
11851    Micheal Phelps dives 
11852    Think you forgot this

11877      OnlyInMontreal   apparently
11878    I think this is the first post I saw about this 
11879    Bravo certainly wasn t considered world class when they bought him 
11880    This is the plotline to Memento isn t it

11892    is that the guy Kanye West made famous 
11893    It s ok  all the other eu migrants will have left as well  so the nhs won t need so many staff

11901    shut up ur racist
11902    Because this is a hentai made into a game 
11903    That s because Trump is literally the spawn of Satan and Hillary is Christ reborn

11910    and still  they would find a way to remove mechanics from it 
11911    What would he know about bad movies 
11912    Probably an xbox
11913    Was that last one an eel 
11914    Thorry Gergich
11915    The morality of the     s also included overt racism  does he want to bring that back too 
11916    But the Commie s  created  a famine in Ukraine  they are so much worse 
11917    Joey Bosa is clearly going to be a bust because the internet scouts said he can only play in a     and the Chargers run a         of the time and talent is only as good as the scheme they are in period

12278    Yes  sovereign governments often impose arbitrary  well  not really  they re based on the votebanks  tarrifs and regulations 
12279    And a car to the foot for good measure 
12280    It s the only good version 
12281    Your title is incredibly misleading compared to what OP actually wrote 
12282    Yes  because when guys talk about the difficulties of being men  we don t even think about how we make up     of workplace fatalities  or     of suicides  or die sooner on average  we only think about how it hurts to get flicked in the balls 
12283    Did Team America do good at the box office 
12284    it only means other providers are overcharging
12285    Looks like I m getting her a boyfriend who s spontaneous and adventurous

12301    Oct     Halloween  and Dec     New Years Eve  are pretty memorable dates  though
12302    Forcing certain people to choose between their religion and education sounds like a great idea
12303    When two main parties pick the only realistic candidates for public office and don t consider themselves public organizations  that s not really democracy  or even a republic to be honest 
12304    It would require Trump to replace high ranking officers of the military with his loyal puppets  and then assuming that they will all fall in line with Trump s demented idea to start a nuclear war 
12305    Yeah cuz Elige and Stewie have proven to be international superstars

12347          nice digs but the lighting made finding a vein harder than expected 
12348    Or better  take a shot and THEN do    push ups 
12349    Last I heard The Matrix was highly inspired by Equilibrium  hence the same clothing style and similar focus in firearm martial arts 
12350    If they insured every package themselves they d just pass those costs on to the customers 
12351    Yes  because their jihadis so far have all been faithful mosque goers
12352    Someone called for my assistance 
12353    Yes  because people who pay streaming services want to go to torrents and steal from artists 
12354    Nah  even when the defense as a whole is a sieve  people will scapegoat Monroe

12386    While that s certainly an option for most  I have a rare meme allergy that precludes me from ingesting large amounts of dankness

12461    Plastics fans

12506    Yeah those lazy modders    first they spent their free time on creating awesome mods and then share them with other players for free  but they are too lazy to upload it to Steam  how dare they

12508    Every raiders fan looks like it is though   
12509    The    M is the current generation of mobile GPUs and I assume the i  will be on of the latest as well

12512    I think this is hinting that he has a track with him and is going to play it tomorrow  or he s tributing the set to Gucci
12513    Hmmm I wonder who Mr Oz is
12514    HOBOMAN   THE HOMELESS HERO PORTLAND DESERVES

12521    deutsche haben doch alle an
12522    because it is totally disgusting that neo nazis and other hate groups can t legally perform nazi salutes at concentration camps
12523    The Holocaust

12526    I liked the dev idea of scientists roaming the island armed  slaying anyone they come into contact with

12536    Summon three     Treants that have    attack the turn they can t attack 
12537    I sure hope it expands upon the Thomas  amp  Martha Wayne murders 
12538    I think the comment is asking where he s from originally  cos I don t think many people from Europe would feel worried intimidated when walking by a group of policemen 
12539    because rito isnt a player focused company and are ded set on screwin us with DQ
12540    This is extremely accurate  and anyone that says otherwise is wrong

12563    Right because everyone should all think alike and believe the same things you do 
12564    NBA s only doing it so when the Warriors get robbed  it ll be without reproach

13536    Yeah it was really frustrating    First we went with the main event  then when that failed by less than     they restarted it via a guild  that run got even more swamped with trolls  and we failed hard    All in all an hour of concerted effort wasted
